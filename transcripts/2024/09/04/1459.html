	<h1>Episode 1</h1>
	<div><p>Hi and welcome to the Babylon Dreams cast.</p>
<p>My name is Alexander Kucera and this is a little experiment in podcasting or microcasting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably going to upload two or three episodes in the next few days since I&rsquo;m attending FMX and that presents a good opportunity to just try this out and see how it goes and if it&rsquo;s fun for me and maybe if anyone is listening they can let me know if it&rsquo;s fun for them and then we&rsquo;ll go from there.</p>
