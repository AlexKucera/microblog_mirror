	<h1>Episode 5 - Prepping the vrscene GUI Intro Video</h1>
	<div><p>Hi, everybody.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sitting in the office, prepping recording for my introductory video for vrcngui, the V-Way render utility I&rsquo;m about to release.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m mostly, let&rsquo;s see, yeah, working in Modo right now, trying to figure out from old backups which scenes are best suited for this type of video.</p>
<p>I need something that&rsquo;s heavy and takes a long time to open and just generally a long time to export just to really show the point of the app.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just opening huge scenes, waiting for them to open, staring at loading screens.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m hoping to have Lauren Thomas do the voiceover for me.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s graciously offered that and I&rsquo;m very excited to hear what she&rsquo;s doing with that.</p>
<p>Her Pixel Fondue tutorial videos are always quite peppy and I like her style.</p>
<p>So yes, I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing that.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the app&rsquo;s finished, the website&rsquo;s finished, documentation is pretty much finished.</p>
<p>Yeah, the only thing missing is really the video and contacting some websites for promotions and press releases and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m hoping to get that out next week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying that for the past several weeks, but still the hope&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So yeah, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Okay, I know I&rsquo;ve been not really regular with these recordings, but that&rsquo;s mostly because I just don&rsquo;t want to waste anybody&rsquo;s time just blabbering into the mic just to have blabbered into the mic.</p>
<p>My life isn&rsquo;t that exciting that I have to record everything once a week or something like that.</p>
<p>That seems wasteful.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m reserving these two times when I actually have something to say.</p>
<p>All right, hear you soon, I guess, or whatever the appropriate goodbye is in audio form.</p>
