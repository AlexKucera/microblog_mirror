<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this for a while now. Amazon used to be simple—a convenient marketplace. But somewhere over the last decade, it became something else. The ecosystem tightened. The restrictions multiplied. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb">Kindle removed the ability to download books to PC</a> in late 2024. <a href="https://www.audible.com/">Audible</a> locks audiobooks behind DRM that I don&rsquo;t actually control. Prime Video quietly added ads. And then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279602/jeff-bezos-washington-post-kamala-harris-endorsement">Bezos killed the Washington Post&rsquo;s Harris endorsement</a>, followed by his visible courtship of the Trump administration—something that crystallized what I was already feeling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be part of this anymore. Not in the way I have been.</p>
<p>So 2026 is the year I reclaim my freedom from Amazon. Not all at once—Amazon&rsquo;s reach is wide, and some things will stay locked in (I accept that). But systematically, service by service, I&rsquo;m going to rebuild my digital life around alternatives that actually respect ownership and independence.</p>
<p>This is my plan.</p>
<h2 id="audiobooks-librofm--audiobookshelf">Audiobooks: Libro.fm + AudiobookShelf</h2>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> <a href="https://www.audible.com/">Audible</a> audiobooks are DRM-locked. I don&rsquo;t own them. I rent access. And when I cancel, unused credits vanish.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong> <a href="https://libro.fm/">Libro.fm</a> costs less (€11.99/month for one credit) but delivers something radical: DRM-free MP3 files I actually own. Plus, <a href="https://libro.fm/howitworks">every purchase supports an independent bookstore of my choice</a>.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going one step further. I&rsquo;m setting up <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org/">AudiobookShelf</a>, a self-hosted audiobook server. I&rsquo;ll download my Libro.fm purchases and host them myself—same way I&rsquo;d host any media. The app is clean, the experience is seamless, and the books are mine.</p>
<p><strong>For existing Audible books:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/rmcrackan/AudiobookHub">Tools exist</a> to convert and preserve them, though this exists in a legal gray area. I&rsquo;m keeping that option available.</p>
<h2 id="e-books-pocketbook-era-color--kavita">E-books: Pocketbook Era Color + Kavita</h2>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Kindle books are locked in Kindle&rsquo;s proprietary format. I can&rsquo;t transfer them. Amazon&rsquo;s device is the only way to read them. And with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb">download restrictions tightening</a>, I&rsquo;m increasingly locked out.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong> I&rsquo;m switching to <a href="https://pocketbook.de/pocketbook-era-color-stormy-sea">Pocketbook Era Color</a> as my e-reader. It&rsquo;s a beautiful 7-inch color E Ink device that reads the industry-standard EPUB format. Unlike Kindle, it connects directly to my library card for borrowing through <a href="https://libbyapp.com/">Libby/OverDrive</a>. And I&rsquo;m pairing it with <a href="https://www.kavitareader.com/">Kavita</a>, a self-hosted e-book server where I&rsquo;ll manage my library locally.</p>
<p><strong>For new purchases:</strong> I&rsquo;m buying DRM-free when possible. Kobo has a large selection of DRM-free ebooks at great prices. Smashwords, Humble Bundle, and publishers like Tor Books and Baen Books offer DRM-free options.</p>
<p><strong>For existing Kindle books:</strong> Same as Audible—<a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">conversion tools </a> <a href="https://github.com/ZacDrum/noDRM-DeDRM_tools">exist</a>. I&rsquo;ll preserve what I&rsquo;ve already purchased.</p>
<h2 id="streaming-video-netflix--apple-tv">Streaming Video: Netflix + Apple TV+</h2>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Prime Video now shows ads by default and charges extra for ad-free viewing. Plus, content disappears—I only access what Amazon decides to keep.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong> <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>. Netflix has the strongest original library. Apple TV+ has shows I actually love, integrates seamlessly with my Apple devices, and feels more aligned with how I think about privacy.</p>
<p><strong>What I keep:</strong> Movies and shows I&rsquo;ve purchased on Prime remain accessible in my account. I&rsquo;m not losing anything I&rsquo;ve actually bought.</p>
<h2 id="music-apple-music">Music: Apple Music</h2>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Amazon Music is mediocre. The discovery algorithm is weak. And I want to consolidate into an ecosystem I actually trust.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> includes lossless audio, integrates perfectly with my devices, and I can bundle it into <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/">Apple One</a> with other services I already use.</p>
<p><strong>For my existing playlists:</strong> <a href="https://www.tunemymusic.com/">TuneMyMusic</a> migrates playlists between services. It&rsquo;s straightforward.</p>
<h2 id="movies--tv-info-callsheet">Movies &amp; TV Info: Callsheet</h2>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> IMDb is clunky and owned by Amazon anyway.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/callsheet-find-cast-crew/id1672356376">Callsheet</a> is a beautiful iOS app for cast, crew, and ratings. It pulls from open-source data and feels designed by someone who actually cares about the experience.</p>
<h2 id="smart-home-homepod-mini">Smart Home: HomePod mini</h2>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Echo devices tie into Amazon&rsquo;s ecosystem and data collection practices.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini </a> (€109) provides on-device processing, better privacy, and works with most smart home standards. I&rsquo;m already in the Apple ecosystem, and this feels like a natural fit.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> exists for full local independence, but that&rsquo;s more technical complexity than I need right now.</p>
<h2 id="shopping-german-retailers--price-comparison">Shopping: German Retailers + Price Comparison</h2>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been conditioned to think Amazon is the easiest place to buy things. It&rsquo;s not the only place.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong> Otto.de, MediaMarkt.de, and other German retailers offer competitive shipping and selection. For price comparison, Idealo and Geizhals show me the best deals across retailers. And buying directly from brand websites often beats Amazon anyway—better customer service, proper warranties.</p>
<p><strong>What changes:</strong> I&rsquo;ll be slightly more intentional about shopping. It takes a few more clicks. That&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<h2 id="the-timeline">The Timeline</h2>
<p>This won&rsquo;t happen overnight. I&rsquo;m thinking of it in phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>January–February: Set up Libro.fm, start the Pocketbook transition, migrate my music playlists</li>
<li>March–April: Get Kavita running, organize my e-book library, test the self-hosted setup</li>
<li>May onwards: Gradually shift shopping habits, let Prime Video fade naturally as I redirect to Netflix/Apple TV+</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal isn&rsquo;t speed. It&rsquo;s completeness. By the end of 2026, Amazon should be a minor part of my digital life instead of a central one.</p>
<h2 id="what-stays-and-im-ok-with-that">What Stays (And I&rsquo;m OK With That)</h2>
<p>Some things won&rsquo;t transfer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing Kindle purchases are trapped in Amazon&rsquo;s ecosystem. I accept that I can&rsquo;t move them, but I can preserve them with conversion tools if needed.</li>
<li>Some streaming content is exclusive to Prime Video. I&rsquo;ll miss some things. That&rsquo;s a trade-off I&rsquo;m willing to make.</li>
<li>AWS powers half the internet, and I can&rsquo;t avoid it entirely. But I can avoid feeding Amazon my personal data and money directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perfect is the enemy of good. I&rsquo;m not trying to be pure. I&rsquo;m trying to reclaim control.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t really about Amazon specifically. It&rsquo;s about freedom. DRM is designed to prevent me from owning what I buy. Ecosystem lock-in is designed to make leaving expensive. And the more I accept both, the less control I have over my own digital life.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m taking it back. Service by service. Month by month. Building something where I own my stuff, where the companies I deal with don&rsquo;t view me as the product, and where leaving is always an option.</p>
<p>2026 is the year I actually own my own life again.</p>
