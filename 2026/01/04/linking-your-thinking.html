<p>Last April, I had emergency surgery. A ruptured cyst on my right kidney meant internal bleeding and, eventually, the loss of the kidney itself. I spent 3.5 weeks in a hospital bed, barely moving. When I finally left, my body was a whisper of what it had been.</p>
<p>The recovery was slow—measured in five to ten-minute walks and long stretches on the couch. But by June, something inside me was restless. I needed to <em>do</em> something again, even if small.</p>
<p>I returned to my desktop and started what has become known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding">vibe coding</a>—low-pressure, creative work that didn&rsquo;t demand much of my healing body. I was lucky to have access to <a href="https://claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a> with the standard plan, which meant my token limits became unintentional rest breaks. This turned out to be perfect. I&rsquo;d work intensely until my tokens ran dry, then I&rsquo;d have to step away. The impatience gnawed at me, but my body needed those forced pauses. It was a rhythm I didn&rsquo;t know I needed: burst of focus, then recovery. Work, then rest.</p>
<p>During those months, I gravitated toward note-taking. I tried a few applications—<a href="https://www.craft.do/de">Craft</a> was genuinely good—but nothing quite fit the way my mind worked. Then I discovered <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, and something clicked. I dove into YouTube videos about it, particularly those by <a href="https://youtube.com/@linkingyourthinking">Nick Milo</a> from <a href="https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/">Linking Your Thinking</a>. His voice is soothing, his approach thoughtful. Watching him talk about notes felt like stumbling onto something that mattered, though I couldn&rsquo;t quite explain why.</p>
<h2 id="discovery-and-hesitation">Discovery and Hesitation</h2>
<p>The more I watched, the more curious I became. I kept seeing references to his <a href="https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/workshop">Linking Your Thinking Workshop</a>—their sixteenth cohort was starting. Part of me wanted to join. Most of me thought it was absurd.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not working anymore. I&rsquo;m on a disability pension. I don&rsquo;t answer to anyone&rsquo;s project management system or corporate knowledge base. Why would I pay nearly my entire monthly pension for a course about making notes? It seemed indulgent, self-important even. So I stepped away from the idea.</p>
<p>But it kept nagging at me. A few weeks later, I did something that surprised myself: I applied for a scholarship from the Linking Your Thinking team. I explained my situation honestly. They said yes.</p>
<p>I still thought I might be wasting money on something I didn&rsquo;t need. But something deeper was pulling me toward this. I couldn&rsquo;t ignore it, so I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right before the workshop began, I learned I had a second surgery scheduled. It would be in October, during the three-week course. I worried. Would I be well enough to participate? Was this going to be another false start?</p>
<p>Then the surgery got pushed. It landed at the end of November instead—just as the workshop was finishing. Suddenly, the timing was impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>I went in.</p>
<h2 id="the-workshop">The Workshop</h2>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d learn a note-taking system. I thought Nick would teach us his <a href="https://blog.linkingyourthinking.com/notes/ace-folder-framework">ACE framework</a> or sell us on the <a href="https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/ideaverse-pro">Ideaverse</a>. Instead, he did something better: he taught us to build our own systems, to think about <em>how we think</em> and make our notes reflect that. The system wasn&rsquo;t the point. Understanding yourself was.</p>
<p>But the real revelation came from the people.</p>
<p>The Linking Your Thinking community felt like stumbling into somewhere I didn&rsquo;t know I needed to be. It was warm, welcoming, genuinely diverse. There was an energy—created intentionally by Nick and his team—that was hard to describe. Familial, maybe. Safe. Over three weeks, I spent hours in Obsidian building my own note system, and it felt <em>really good</em>. Not in the way productive work feels good. In the way coming home feels good.</p>
<p>When it ended, I felt the loss sharply.</p>
<p>The community doesn&rsquo;t disappear after the workshop closes. You stay connected, which matters more than I expected it to.</p>
<p>But I wanted more. So I&rsquo;ve committed to the full year with their <a href="https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/accelerator">Knowledge Accelerator</a> program. There&rsquo;s another workshop in February, plus monthly mini-workshops and courses throughout the year. I&rsquo;m genuinely looking forward to it.</p>
<p>I know I probably won&rsquo;t recreate that first, bright intensity of discovery and inspiration. That was a specific moment—a person healing, finding community, stumbling onto something that fit exactly when they needed it to. Those things don&rsquo;t repeat in the same way.</p>
<p>But if I can hold onto even a fraction of what I found there, it will have been worth every penny and every moment of doubt.</p>
