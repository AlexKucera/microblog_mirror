&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I came across one of the most German things I have seen in a long time. Apparently there is such a thing as an &amp;ldquo;ArbeitsschutzgetraÌˆnk&amp;rdquo;, which means &amp;ldquo;worker protection drink&amp;rdquo;. In essence it is an isotonic drink for workers in high heat work places. But I find it hilarious that we Germans felt the need to come up with a convoluted word for it.&lt;/p&gt;
