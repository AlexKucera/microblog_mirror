<p>Yesterday I came across one of the most German things I have seen in a long time. Apparently there is such a thing as an &ldquo;ArbeitsschutzgetraÌˆnk&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;worker protection drink&rdquo;. In essence it is an isotonic drink for workers in high heat work places. But I find it hilarious that we Germans felt the need to come up with a convoluted word for it.</p>
