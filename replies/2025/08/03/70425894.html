	<div><p><a href="https://micro.blog/jsonbecker">@jsonbecker</a> personally, my AI tools of choice are Claude Code for coding projects and Typing Mind as my “chatting” app. It allows me to design my own agents and can have talking different agents to each other. For example, I have an agent that goes back and forth with me nailing down a project spec. Then I have five other agents review the plan and make improvement suggestion and then I have an agent that assesses all the reviews and bundles them up with the original spec into a “final” spec. Works really well.</p>
