	<div><p><a href="https://micro.blog/hutaffe">@hutaffe</a> API usage can be dangerous. I recently added file system access to my chat interface so I could ask the AI to summarize and write conversations to disk. I asked it about how to create something in a script and before I realized it the AI decided to help me create the complete script and blew through $5 before I realized what was happening. With the subscription limit runaway prompts still happen, but are less critical because it simply stops at the limit and then resets. Of course, if the reset is in a week, that will suck.</p>
