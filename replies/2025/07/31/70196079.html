	<div><p><a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> ok. Big feature request. Make it easier to manage more then one account. Having to constantly log in and out of the website to manage mine and my wife‘s account is driving me nuts. Especially since you don‘t offer password or passkey signing. This whole email signin procedure is taking way too long. And now I also have to constantly ask my wife for the login code when I switch accounts. Less then ideal.</p>
<p>Sorry had to vent a bit.</p>
<p>Can we please get password login? That would be so much more convenient.</p>
