	<div><p><a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> Iâ€™m thinking about how exporting to Micro.blog would work from Links since it is not saving pages in the traditional sense. A saved bookmark consists of a folder with a metadata.json inside as well as a PDF, a Markdown and a WARC of the bookmark. Would this be just a plain bookmark export to import as Micro.blog bookmark? Would this be a proper blog page with attachments/uploads?</p>
