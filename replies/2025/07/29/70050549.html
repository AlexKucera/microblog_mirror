	<div><p><a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> @anyone I am looking into getting my wife onto Micro.blog. What would be the best way to do that? Get her her own subscription and account or upgrade to the premium plan and let her just use my account? Or the family plan although that doesnâ€™t give her her own blog either, right? Just her own login I guess?</p>
