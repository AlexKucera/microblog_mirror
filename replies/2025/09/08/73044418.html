	<div><p><a href="https://micro.blog/danielpunkass">@danielpunkass</a> I mean, sure, therapy is probably nice. But honestly, I feel like pretty much every American podcaster talks about his therapist at one point or another. So much so that I always believed it is just a thing that you all have a therapist.<br>
Here in Germany I know of no one going to a therapist. Or at least it is not talked about at all.</p>
