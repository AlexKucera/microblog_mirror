I get why Fahrenheit set his zero where he did. But then he went „hmm. My second point of reference shall be the freezing temperature of water and I call that 32°!“ what?? Oh and then he goes to set a third reference point as the average human temperature (which he got wrong) and sets it to 96°? Why not 100? Btw. I do realize I’m totally biased growing up in Celsius-land.</p>
