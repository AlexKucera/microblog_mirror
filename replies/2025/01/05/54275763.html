	<div><p>@DaveyCraney they came out rather well. It wasn’t hard, but very time consuming. I only had this one silicone form and you need to bake them really slowly or the bottom burns before the top sets. About 15 minutes per crumpet and I made dough for nine crumpets. You can do the math. :)</p>
<p>Next time I need to get me a set of crumpet rings so I can bake three or four at the same time.</p>
<p>This is the recipe I followed → <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/crumpet-recipe/">Crumpet Recipe</a></p>
