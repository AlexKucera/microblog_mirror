	<div><p><a href="https://micro.blog/cheesemaker">@cheesemaker</a> depends on the type of milk. In Germany we have H-Milch, which has been heated to about 150°C for a few seconds and therefore been sterilized. It keeps several months unrefrigerated. Downside is it tastes like cooked milk and has some of it’s vitamins destroyed. If possible buy milk from the refrigerated section.</p>
