		<p>I was on set last week and I felt like back in school again. People preparing lamps and set pieces, just like preparing for a school dance.</p>
<p>I have this feeling more often lately when talking to my colleagues. A feeling like a teenager at play. Like me and my buddy writing a script and discussing how we solve this issue and approach that scene. A feeling of adventure, of doing something like the big guys.</p>
<p>It is like I have no idea what I am doing, but so do all the others. The only difference between now and then being, that it is our daily job and we get paid for it. Is that good or bad?</p>
<p>We get to play our favorite game, sure, but on the other hand we call ourselves professionals and charge money for playing around, pretending to have a clue.</p>
<p>Do you know that feeling?</p>
