		<p>The [Doncaster Road End] <a href="http://doncaster-road-end.com/">1</a> blog has posted about the Infernal video we re-did for the world cup (you can read about it in one of my older posts). In [their post] <a href="http://doncaster-road-end.com/?p=134">2</a> they review several songs that were… er… well… mutilated to make a quick buck of the world cup. “From London to Berlin” actually made a reasonable standing. Thanks guys!</p>
<p>I am aware that this was no high quality piece, but believe me, it was at least a challenge from the technical side. And I actually think it works better then the original version. In this new one the story tells better and clearer.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the review.</p>
