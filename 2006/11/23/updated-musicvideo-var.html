		<p>Remember Emilia? She did this song called “Big Big World” about 7 years ago:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v=BUKq7DLo6Ko">Big Big World</a></p>
<p>Guess what? She is back, with her new song “Var Minut”, which means “Every Minute” and is the usual thing about love I guess. I can’t really tell though, because she is singing in Swedish and I don’t understand a single word of it. ;-)</p>
<p>Anyway, I was VFX Supervisor on set and also the main guy to do the VFX in post. Time was short — as always — so the quality is barely enough for TV but should be bearable for the web. There are 8 greenscreen shots and 7 fire-only shots that we had 5 days to work on.</p>
<p>Take a look:</p>

<p>Someone from the set also made a nice [Flickr slideshow] <a href="http://www.f-film.com">3</a>, go check it out.</p>
<p>UPDATE: And of course we also have a making of that comes in two parts (for a commercial break) now.</p>
