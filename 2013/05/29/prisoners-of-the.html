<p>Today,29.05.2013, was the official premiere of <strong>Prisoners of the Sun</strong>, the movie I was VFX producer for and that crashed and burned in 2008 due to a licensing issue. Luxx Studios bought the rights a while back and finished it. It turned out to be a modestly solid B-movie with 3D effects that looked very game-y, which is very sad, because we all—the former production crew—knew what it could have been.</p>
<p>Sadly, not having the rights to the material tends to throw a wrench into finishing up a movie, or any project.</p>
