		<p><em>This talk was very theory heavy with lots of formulas and photos of curves that summarize pretty badly. I still gave it a try here.</em></p>
<p>The session started with the history of camera tech. From the first wooden boxes with a hand crank.</p>
<p>A hand cranked camera had severe restrictions in that it obviously only could film where a human operator could go and there wasn&rsquo;t even adjustable focus. Since then we have come a long way. Huge VistaVision camera rigs, car cranes with two seat at the top end of the crane (Titan crane) and Technocranes, which was the first camera crane that didn&rsquo;t need someone to look through the lens allowing much greater range of camera freedom. This was thanks to Jerry Lewis idea of a video feed.</p>
<p>After that came the motion control rigs, which not only allow repeatable motion to shot many matching passes of a shot, but also allow the combination of live footage with camera matched 3D footage or miniature footage.</p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s imperative to set up your film back accurately</li>
<li>after that setting the focal length should give you the correct field of view</li>
<li>you need to set up your nodal point on set correctly</li>
<li>live action usually is <strong>not</strong> nodal, meaning there is a parallax while panning</li>
<li>this must be matched  in the 3D camera</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="real-life-camera-motion-in-3d">Real Life Camera Motion In 3D</h3>
<p>Cameras must adhere to physics, which means there is a limit to the acceleration of an object. Not speed. Acceleration. Meaning sharp changes in speed, up or down, directional changes.</p>
<p>The acceleration can be derived by the second order derivative of the position change (translation curve). Ideally, you want your 3D curves to accelerate gradually with no more the 9.82 m/s or 1G. Some motion control sYstems can handle more or less.</p>
<p>Of course, there is also a certain speed limit involved.</p>
<h3 id="problems-capturing-live-motion-for-repeatability">Problems Capturing Live Motion For Repeatability</h3>
<p>A problem arises when you have a camera motion, usually SteadyCam shots, that you need to transform into a motion control shot. For example, you film your actors with a SteadyCam in a greenscreen setup and then you need to repeat that move with a motion control rig on a different set or a miniature.</p>
<p>The way to go about it is to match move (track) the shot, which will give you a rather noisy result, at least in motion control terms, which you won&rsquo;t be able to program. You can smooth the result, which will loose you accuracy, but enables you to program the shot. The trick is to filter enough, without leading to misalignment.</p>
