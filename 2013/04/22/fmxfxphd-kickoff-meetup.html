<p>Yesterday evening was the first of likely many fxphd meetups this week. About 15 people showed up and had a relaxed chat. It was a great time to catch up with old friends and meet new faces.</p>

<p>Movies were discussed, Schnitzels eaten and some teased (twitter: johnmontfx text: John Montgomery), who sadly couldn&rsquo;t make it this year, with pictures of delicious wheat beer like the cruel friend we are.</p>

<p>All in all it was great seeing everyone again and to have some light non-FMX, but of course still VFX chat.</p>
