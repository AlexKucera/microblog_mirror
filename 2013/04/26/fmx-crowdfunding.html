		<p>Phil Tippett had a dream. &ldquo;Mad God&rdquo; a film that he wanted to make, but for a variety of reasons got put on hold around the time of Jurassic Park.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Lack of money. Simple as that. To get it you used to ask friends, family and people foolish enough to invest In your little project. That lead to a lot of concession being made. Giving the rights to creative input away to investors, having investors kids in the movie, etc.</p>
<h2 id="a-possible-solution---crowdfunding">A Possible Solution - Crowdfunding</h2>
<p><em>Mad God</em> got funding via Kickstarter and Corey talked us through what he has learned.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make your objective clear<br>
If you cannot define your product, then people have no concept of what they are buying into.</li>
<li>Make your pitch personal</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t come off as aloof. If people sense that you don&rsquo;t <em>need/want</em> their money, they&rsquo;ll take it elsewhere.</li>
<li>Set a realistic budget
<ul>
<li>As in make a spreadsheet and <strong>plan</strong> things</li>
<li>Limit your reward costs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make your project accessible to backers at all levels</li>
<li>Let the project reflect you and your idea</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to fail</li>
<li>Treat your campaign as a <strong>campaign</strong>
<ul>
<li>Advertise via social networks like Facebook, Twitter, App.net, LinkedIn</li>
<li>Get people that are <em>influencers</em> to push your project to their followers/readers</li>
<li>Write frequent updates during the campaign</li>
<li>Ride the wave of spikes and plateaus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Treat your backers with respect</li>
</ul>
