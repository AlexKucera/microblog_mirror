<p>I got access to my copy of <a href="http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun">Shadowrun Returns</a> right on release, July 25th, and immediately ended up playing it of about five hours. Probably your first clue that I liked it.</p>
<p>It has been described as Neverwinter Nights meets XCOM by its creators and that description is pretty accurate. I&rsquo;d add that it at times also has a little point and click adventure feel to it.</p>
<h2 id="on-a-budget">On A Budget</h2>
<p>Harebrained Software got $1.8 Million from Kickstarter, which, when you take away all the Kickstarter and Amazon fees plus physical rewards, ends up as about $1.2 Million for the actual game. It later racked up the budget with a loan and additional Pre-sales done via their website, so I&rsquo;m assuming that the actual budget ended up in the $2 Million range again. Which sounds like a lot, but it really isn&rsquo;t if you do the math.</p>
<p>Anyway, the developers did a remarkable job of translating the Shadowrun experience into a playable and infinitely expandable game. The environments are gorgeous, the first story that came with it is pretty solid and supposed to be about 12 hours of gameplay.</p>
<p>You can really only tell that they needed to cut stuff by the lack of detail in the characters. They just feel a little unpolished at times. The 3D characters that is. The character art is top notch.</p>
<p>Another thing that&rsquo;s sorely missing to give the game that extra bit of atmosphere is a voice over track. It&rsquo;s just a little lackluster to read all the dialogue. But I guess with the idea of an editor that allows you to expand the game ad infinitum, a VO track seems a little unrealistic.</p>
<p>But in the end, <a href="http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun">Shadowrun Returns</a> remains a great, atmospheric game and anyone even mildly into the Shadowrun universe owes himself to check it out.</p>
