<p>I don&rsquo;t have my own camera kit specifically for VFX yet. Usually when I am on set, I either rent or get equipment from the production that is hiring me. Now I am about to build my own camera kit and to stay halfway reasonable I want to stay around €6000, though I can go over that amount to get a better kit if need be. And it looks like I might have to.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d ask you guys for opinions on what to get and if I maybe can switch around a few things to get the most bang for my buck. Also, writing it all down is more for my benefit really, as it allows me to think through things better.</p>
<p>The goal is to build a kit that works well in four different situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional:
<ul>
<li>Set photography (making reference photos, shooting textures, making set HDRis, etc.)</li>
<li>Panorama photography (HDRi and normal panoramas)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal:
<ul>
<li>Since I am a rather new dad (boy, 10 months) I will use the camera for child photography. He is already a speedy little guy and I only see this getting more intense as time moves on.</li>
<li>Also, we own three ferrets who are even speedier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So all things considered, I am looking to build a kit that serves well for kid and animal photography as well as on set photography.</p>
<h2 id="the-list">The List</h2>
<p>So far my list looks like this (all prices are not yet researched for cheapness but mostly straight off of Amazon):</p>
<h3 id="cameras">Cameras:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Canon 7D ~€1200</li>
<li>Canon 5D Mark III ~€2600</li>
<li>Canon 5D Mark II ~€2300</li>
</ul>
<p>I am itching for the full frame sensor. Getting the older MK2 doesn&rsquo;t seem to make much sense as it was still rather expensive when I looked.</p>
<p>The 7D I am unsure about. Yes, it is cheaper, but also not a full frame sensor. However, I could use the saved money to get more/better glass.</p>
<p>Another added benefit of the less then full frame sensor is that is allows me to capture a higher resolution panorama with the 8mm Sigma at the cost of needing one or two more shots to get a full 360° panorama. So higher res, but slower workflow.</p>
<h3 id="lenses">Lenses:</h3>
<p>The options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sigma 8mm Fisheye ~€750</li>
<li>Canon 50mm F1.2 (~€1400) or F1.4 (~€300)</li>
<li>Canon 70-200mm f2,8 ~€1000 (without image stabilization) or -2000 (with image stabilization)</li>
<li>Canon 70-200mm ~€1000 (or I go f4 with image stabilization)</li>
<li>Canon 20mm f2.8 ~€450</li>
<li>Canon EF 16-35mm 1:2,8L II USM ~€1300</li>
<li>Sigma 35 mm f/1,4 DG HSM ~€800</li>
<li>Canon EF 35mm 1:1,4 L USM ~€1300</li>
<li>Canon 24-70mm f2.8 ~€2000</li>
<li>Canon Extender EF 2x III ~€480</li>
</ul>
<p>I am only sure about the 8mm Sigma and pretty sure I want to get a 70-200mm, but inbetween I am torn. Get a 50mm prime or a 24-70mm zoom? Maybe a 35mm? 85mm?</p>
<p>I do like the added quality and speed of a prime lens. For my main use case, which will be professional panorama photography, I think I&rsquo;m going to go 8mm (standard, quick on-set pano HDR), 20mm (high-res on-set HDR pano) and 50mm (for those gigapanos and child photography).</p>
<p>The 70-200mm will be used for capturing textures and general on-set photography. Still not sure if I want the added quality of the f2.8 or if the f4 with image stabilization is good enough. It is a 1000 bucks difference after all.</p>
<h3 id="mounts-and-tripods">Mounts and Tripods:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nodal Ninja with RD16 €449</li>
<li>Manfrotto 055CXPRO4 or 190CXPRO4 ~€200 (not sure, both cost about the same. I am open for other less pricey brands as well)</li>
<li>I already have a ball head</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup is pretty fixed. I like the Nodal Ninja and I have a ball head. I am open for a less expensive tripod, but given the quality of Manfrotto, €200 isn&rsquo;t too bad, really.</p>
<h3 id="remotes">Remotes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Promote ~€380</li>
<li>Canon tc-80n3 ~€140</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m unsure about the MK3&rsquo;s bracketing as it only offers 1EV steps at maximum. The Promote would allow me to control that better, but it is double of the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; (and already rather pricey) Canon remote.</p>
<h3 id="all-the-other-stuff-one-needs-and-that-sucks-money-away">All the other stuff one needs and that sucks money away:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sandisk Compact Flash Extreme 32GB 60MB/s (I really don&rsquo;t see the point of going faster then 60 MB/s I&rsquo;m not planning to do much video with it) ~€75 a pop about three or four of these</li>
<li>Pelican card case ~€40</li>
<li>DELOCK Card Reader-FireWire ~€50</li>
<li>Hama Lenspen ~€12</li>
<li>Peli 1510 Carry On Case ~€300 or a nice huge backpack that can fit all of this gear. I&rsquo;m open for suggestions here.</li>
<li>a ruler of known length for matchmoving purposes</li>
<li>greyball 18% grey</li>
<li>Spyder Cube (was thinking of taking this instead of the grey ball as it is easier to get then 18% grey paint p lus it is very portable) ~€50</li>
<li>LightCraft Variable ND Fader ND MKII ~€100</li>
<li>B+W Cirkular Polarizer Käsemann F-Pro MRC DH 77mm ~€120</li>
<li>Leatherman Wave ~€70</li>
<li>X-Rite MSCCPP Passport ColorChecker ~€70</li>
<li>Leica D2 Laser measure ~€110</li>
<li>Bosch auto levelling laser cross ~€50</li>
<li>Canon battery packs LP-E6 ~€50</li>
<li>Suunto Pm-5 Clinometer ~€150</li>
<li>various self printed lens charts and tracking markers</li>
<li>tapes a whole bunch of them</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aperture (which I already have)</li>
<li>ptGUI (which I also already have)</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite the list, eh?</p>
<p>I think the stuff at the bottom is pretty much locked in (and already a hefty 1300 bucks price tag), but I am pretty uncertain how to balance the stuff at the top, especially lenses.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
