		<p>I just found an article on the BusinessWeek site entitled [“How Not to Be the Obnoxious Newcomer”] <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/jun2007/ca20070607_981821.htm">1</a>.
It seems that author [Liz Ryan] <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bios/Liz_Ryan.htm">2</a> has also stumbled over one too many of those annoying people that waltz in on their first day and step on everybody’s toes, just like I did a while ago when I wrote (link: blog/newbie_dont_act_like_a_pro text:“If you are a newbie, don’t act like a pro!”).</p>
<p>Liz thinks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s no doubt that every organization has a few best practices to share. As the new kid on the block, you can share what you’ve learned elsewhere and make a real contribution to your new employer’s operations. But if you lend that expertise in such a way that people roll their eyes and drift away when you enter a conversation, you’re not helping anyone—even worse, you’re setting yourself up to have negative credibility with your peers.</p>
