				"title": "We've Confused Business Tools with Life Optimization",
				"content_html": "<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/239/2025/1cf1603485.jpg\" alt=\"Ein modernes Büro mit einem Computerbildschirm und einer mit vielen Notizen und Dokumenten bedeckten Wand.\" class=\"full-width\">\n<h3 id=\"why-personal-knowledge-management-is-often-just-productivity-theater\">Why Personal Knowledge Management is Often Just Productivity Theater</h3>\n<p>I have a confession: in my 45 years on this planet, I&rsquo;ve collected an enormous amount of information. Files, bookmarks, articles, videos, notes, screenshots – you name it, I&rsquo;ve probably saved it somewhere. I like the <em>idea</em> of knowledge managers like <a href=\"https://logseq.com\">Logseq</a>, <a href=\"https://www.craft.do\">Craft</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.notion.so\">Notion</a>. The promise is seductive: capture everything, organize it systematically, and transform into some sort of information superhuman who can recall any fact or insight at will.</p>\n<p>But here&rsquo;s the uncomfortable truth – I hardly ever revisit any of it. When I actually need to know something again, I don&rsquo;t turn to my carefully curated <a href=\"https://cdfinder.de\">NeoFinder</a> database or my elaborate folder structures. I just Google it. Or search on <a href=\"https://kagi.com\">Kagi</a>. Or ask <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai\">Perplexity</a>. The information I need is usually just a search away, delivered faster and more accurately than I could ever dig it out of my own archives.</p>\n<p>The irony of this realization hit me just this week. I recently got a 6-month subscription to Craft when I purchased a software bundle, and I&rsquo;ve spent the last few days obsessively trying to find a way to fit it into my workflow. I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with templates, exploring its linking features, and imagining elaborate organizational schemes for all my scattered thoughts and bookmarks. But the honest truth? I&rsquo;m trying to create a need for a knowledge manager when I don&rsquo;t actually need one. I&rsquo;m attempting to justify a tool by inventing problems for it to solve.</p>\n<p>This is productivity theater at its most seductive – the feeling of optimizing and organizing without any clear benefit. Why do I keep doing this? Why do millions of us keep building these elaborate personal knowledge management systems that we barely use? I think we&rsquo;ve fallen for one of productivity culture&rsquo;s most persistent lies: that we should manage our personal information like businesses manage their critical data.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a fundamental difference between the project specifications I need for work, the architectural decisions that could cost thousands if forgotten, or the client contact details that represent real relationships and revenue – and that fascinating article about medieval farming techniques I bookmarked &ldquo;for later reading.&rdquo; One category has real consequences. The other is just intellectual curiosity dressed up as productivity.</p>\n<p>Yet somewhere along the way, we started treating both with the same systematic rigor. We began filing random YouTube videos like they were legal contracts. We started organizing casual reading lists like they were product roadmaps. We turned every moment of curiosity into a cataloging task, every interesting link into homework for our future selves.</p>\n<p>The personal knowledge management industry has convinced us this is normal, even admirable. They&rsquo;ve created beautiful tools and compelling methodologies that make the act of organizing information feel profound and important. The &ldquo;Second Brain&rdquo; concept sounds revolutionary until you realize that your actual brain, combined with the internet, already does this job pretty well for most things that matter in daily life.</p>\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/239/2025/fc82e009a6.jpg\" alt=\"Eine Silhouette einer Person steht vor einem digitalen, bunten Hintergrund voller überlagernder Bildschirme und Symbole.\">\n<p>I&rsquo;ve watched friends spend hours perfecting their <a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> workflows, tweaking their Notion databases, and migrating between different note-taking systems in search of the perfect setup. The irony is stark: they spend more time organizing information than using it. The system becomes the goal instead of the means. It&rsquo;s productivity theater – the appearance of being more organized and knowledgeable without actually becoming more effective.</p>\n<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if these systems were just harmless hobbies, but research suggests they&rsquo;re not. Studies show that digital hoarding behaviors affect about half of all Americans and can contribute to as much as 37% of an individual&rsquo;s anxiety levels. We create these elaborate information architectures, then feel guilty when we don&rsquo;t maintain them, stressed when we can&rsquo;t find things in them, and overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content we&rsquo;ve committed to &ldquo;processing someday.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The anxiety is real because we&rsquo;ve created artificial obligations to ourselves. Every saved article becomes a promise to read it. Every bookmarked video becomes a commitment to watch it. Every note becomes a task to review and connect to other notes. We&rsquo;ve turned the simple act of encountering interesting information into a complex project management challenge.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Google has gotten incredibly good at finding information. Perplexity can synthesize answers from multiple sources instantly. Kagi delivers relevant results without the noise. The tools for real-time information discovery have become so powerful that maintaining personal archives for general knowledge often makes as much sense as keeping a home library of phone books.</p>\n<p>But here&rsquo;s where it gets interesting: I do see the value in knowledge management for certain things. My NeoFinder database isn&rsquo;t really about daily information retrieval – it&rsquo;s about long-term archival of specific materials that might genuinely disappear from the internet. Project documentation at work isn&rsquo;t optional; it&rsquo;s how teams function and how institutional memory survives personnel changes. Client contact information and project specifications have real-world consequences if lost.</p>\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/239/2025/b0221426a6.jpg\" alt=\"Auf der linken Seite sind ordentlich sortierte Dokumente zu sehen, während die rechte Seite einen chaotischen Stapel aus Papier neben einem Computerbildschirm zeigt.\">\n<p>The difference is purpose and stakes. Work-related knowledge management serves clear, immediate needs with measurable consequences. Personal knowledge management, for most of us, serves psychological needs we don&rsquo;t always acknowledge – the feeling of being prepared, the identity of being someone who &ldquo;keeps track of things,&rdquo; the illusion of control in an information-saturated world.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s something liberating about recognizing this distinction. It means you can stop feeling guilty about not reviewing your saved articles. You can abandon that elaborate tagging system you set up but never maintain. You can let most information remain temporary, encountered and appreciated in the moment rather than preserved for an imaginary future self who will have both the time and inclination to systematically review everything you found interesting.</p>\n<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean becoming an information nihilist. It means being honest about what actually deserves systematic management versus what we can trust to the cloud of collective human knowledge that is the modern internet. It means recognizing that for most casual learning and curiosity, the best knowledge management system is often no system at all – just the confidence that when you need to know something again, you&rsquo;ll be able to find it.</p>\n<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll find a genuine use for Craft over the next six months, or maybe I&rsquo;ll learn to be comfortable with the fact that a beautifully designed tool doesn&rsquo;t need to become part of my life just because I have access to it. The goal isn&rsquo;t to become an information processing machine. It&rsquo;s to remain curious and engaged while accepting that not every interesting thing needs to become a project. Sometimes the most productive thing you can do with information is simply let it go.</p>\n<p>(The images in this post were created with MidJourney.)</p>\n",

I would walk up to them with a pen and a sheet of paper asking that they immediately draw me a men’s bicycle, by heart. Soon I found out that when confronted with this odd request most people have a very hard time remembering exactly how a bike is made. Some did get close, some actually nailed it perfectly, but most ended up drawing something that was pretty  far off from a regular men’s bicycle.\nLittle I knew this is actually a test that psychologists use to demonstrate how our brain sometimes tricks us into thinking we know something even though we don’t.\nI collected hundreds of drawings, building up a collection that I think is very precious. There is an incredible diversity of new typologies emerging from these crowd-sourced and technically error-driven drawings. A single designer could not invent so many new bike designs in 100 lifetimes and this is why  I look at this collection in such awe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Such a great idea.</p>\n<p>There are some really beautiful designs in there and a few I wouldn&rsquo;t mind taking for a ride.</p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"http://www.gianlucagimini.it/prototypes/velocipedia.html\">www.gianlucagimini.it/prototype&hellip;</a></p>\n<p>Via: <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/04/15/impossible-bikes\" title=\"John Gruber\">John Gruber</a></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/239/2024/d7800d64ae.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"203\" alt=\"\">\n<p>Yes, I finally am blogging again. Only 6 months of silence this time. Not too shabby.</p>\n<p>Anyway, a major hindrance was that my blogging workflow wasn&rsquo;t working quite right yet, which in turn was like an invisible wall that I was just too tired to climb each time I want to post something. Luckily, I have had the last two days to tinker with it and to figure it out. Now I have a pretty solid workflow. Well, at the moment it looks solid. It is not battle tested however. That&rsquo;s what future blog posts are for.</p>\n<p>But since it is a little involved, I thought I&rsquo;d write it down here right away. For one so I won&rsquo;t forget and also some friends asked me how I am handling blogging from iOS to my <a href=\"http://getkirby.com\">Kirby</a> blog.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tldr1\">Tl;dr<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></h2>\n<p>Write your post in whatever text editor you prefer. Ideally one that supports x-callbacks. I personally use Editorial since it&rsquo;s nice for writing and I also use it for processing everything anyway. Before that I used Drafts together with Editorial.</p>\n<p>Fire off the Editorial workflow that transforms your text into a blog post with the correct formatting and uploads it to Dropbox.</p>\n<p>Create or edit any imagery that goes along with the post and upload the images to the right Dropbox folder. The path of said folder has been copied to the clipboard by the above Editorial workflow.</p>\n<p>Have Hazel put everything into place and let it upload to post to the web server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-long-version\">The long version</h2>\n<p>There are several steps involved to make this work. It sounds complicated, but is actually rather straightforward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://getkirby.com\">Kirby</a>, of course.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/\">Drafts</a> (or any other editor that allows you to send stuff to Editorial via <a href=\"http://x-callback-url.com/\">x-callback URLs</a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://omz-software.com/editorial/\">Editorial</a>, <a href=\"http://omz-software.com/pythonista/index.html\">Pythonista</a> works equally well, but Editorial is simpler to set up, plus you can write in Editorial as well and just skip <em>Drafts</em> entirely, which is what I do most of the time.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://filterstormneue.com\">Filterstorm Neue</a> or alternatively Photoforge 2 if you still have access to it.</li>\n<li>Dropbox</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.noodlesoft.com\">Hazel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.crushftp.com\">CrushFTP</a>, optional, but depending on the image editor you use more convenient</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"kirby\">Kirby</h3>\n<p>First of all, why Kirby? Sounds like an awful lot of work for something that Tumblr offers for free. Tumblr even has an iOS app. Just log in and be done with it.</p>\n<p>For me it comes down to owning what I create. And that involves hosting  what I create. Yes, Kirby is a little more involved and— <em>gasp</em> —costs money, but it is really flexible—I built several sites with it for myself, friends and even customers—, fast and pretty cheap considering.</p>\n<p>Plus it works with text files and Markdown, both things that I value dearly and that make this specific workflow possible without a special &ldquo;<em>Kirby iOS app</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"drafts-optional\">Drafts (optional)</h3>\n<p><em>For completeness sake I&rsquo;m including my Drafts workflow as well. However, I have since completely switched over to Editorial for writing as well as post-processing my posts.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I started writing my posts in Agile Tortoise&rsquo;s Drafts, a fine and frictionless text editor with the added bonus that it supports the x-callback URL scheme and a ton of other ways to share or manipulate the written word.</p>\n<p>When I write a blog entry, I put the post&rsquo;s title in the first line and the actual post content right after it. If I want a subtitle, that goes at the very bottom with the tag <code>Subtitle:</code></p>\n<p>So a typical post in Drafts would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>This is my title\n\nAnd this is my content.\nIt can have any content. Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it.\n\n----\n\nSubtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle.\n</code></pre>\n<p>When it comes time to share my post with the world, I have a Dropbox action called <em>Blog Post</em>, that will create a file in a designated Dropbox folder—I have a global <em>Apps</em> folder and I put it in a subfolder there—with the name of my post title as filename. It will also fill in a couple of things for me. Most notably the date and the title. So the above post transforms into:</p>\n<p>&lsquo;<code>This is my title.md</code>&rsquo; with the following content:</p>\n<pre><code>Title: This is my title\n\n----\n\nDate: 07.11.13 (used for display purposes)\n\n----\n\nTime: 2013-11-07-17-33-55 (used for sorting purposes)\n\n----\n\nAnd this is my content.\nIt can have any content.

Jump to the second part to see how I&rsquo;m working right now.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"the-old-way\">The <em>old</em> way</h4>\n<p>The next two steps are only for the times I want or need images in my posts or if I want to create one of those snazzy banners that are sorely underrepresented in my blog.</p>\n<p>I use Editorial as a simple text filter in this case. I could write something like this for Pythonista to make it work on iPhone (Editorial is iPad only), but I, well, I didn&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>\n<p>Editorial simply gives me back the future path of my new blog post, something I need if I want to drop pictures into that folder without hunting for the correct folder in my next step.</p>\n<p>I send over my post from Drafts to Editorial with a simple x-callback URL.</p>\n<p>You can import the URL Action into Drafts by clicking this link: <a href=\"drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=URL&amp;name=Copy%20Blog%20Path&amp;url=editorial%3A%2F%2F%3Fcommand%3D%7B%7Bcreate%20blog%20URL%7D%7D%26input%3D%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D\">→ Import URL action &ldquo;Copy Blog Path&rdquo; into Drafts</a></p>\n<p>Editorial then cleans it up in a variety of ways. For example, everything gets turned to lowercase, spaces are removed, etc.</p>\n<p>The resulting URL is copied to the clipboard. In the example above <code>This is my title</code> turns into <code>http://alexanderkucera.com/20131108-this_is_my_title</code>.</p>\n<p>I opted not to run any action after this, as I want to be able to switch to any app I want as the situation requires. But usually it is now on to <em>Filterstorm</em>.</p>\n<p>If you want to import the URL cleanup workflow into Editorial or simply read through it in detail, you can take a look at this <a href=\"http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5035202761981952/hTzXZVeWcLI\">&ldquo;create blog URL&rdquo; Editorial Action</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"the-new-way\">The <em>new</em> way</h4>\n<p>Since I have completely switched over from Drafts to Editorial, I had to create a workflow that would prep a standard Markdown document and turn it into a blog post. Since Editorial is much more powerful then Drafts, I was also able to make it a bit smarter, ask for input on a few things and optionally archive or delete a post once I&rsquo;m done with it.</p>\n<p>It does a lot of things similar to my Drafts workflow though. After all is said and done, a file with the correct naming scheme gets written to a Dropbox folder. And I also get the blog URL at the end from the workflow above.</p>\n<p>The bonus with the Editorial workflow is that I don&rsquo;t need to watch out for any specific formatting. I can have a standard Markdown document and everything <em>just works™</em>. And Editorial is just really pleasant to work in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5895905618165760/iEqPb0_XVkw\">Editorial Blog Posting Workflow</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"filterstorm-neue\">Filterstorm (Neue)</h3>\n<p>Filterstorm Neue, is brand new, but the old Filterstorm or Filterstorm Pro have pretty much the same abilities. Or you could use Photoforge 2 if you still have it. The important bit is that the app allows you to either <strong>export to Dropbox or to upload via FTP</strong> and to give your images <strong>a name of your choosing</strong>.</p>\n<p>Well, this step is really simple. Do your image edits. Done? Ok. Then upload it to the folder we just had the path created for in Editorial. Simple, right?</p>\n<p>Well, yes and no. There is one step that I consider crucial. I don&rsquo;t want to upload to my web server. I want to upload my image to Dropbox. I consider the Dropbox version of my site to be the canonical copy. Everything goes there first and then gets uploaded to the server. Otherwise I end up with a file mess. Files might get updated or changed here or there. Who knows? By always going Dropbox first, that issue gets sidestepped completely.</p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have an <em>always on</em> server machine, your best bet is to find a way to upload to Dropbox directly. Photoforge has a Dropbox uploading feature. Filterstorm does as well, though it involves browsing to your posts folder manually instead of just giving it a path.</p>\n<p>For various reasons, mostly because I don&rsquo;t want to hunt down a folder and I have the exact path I need from my Editorial workflow above, I decided to go a completely different route: FTP.</p>\n<p>I happen to use CrushFTP for work anyway, which means I just need to set up an FTP account that points to the blog&rsquo;s content folder in my server&rsquo;s Dropbox folder and the rest is very straightforward. Get path from Editorial and upload to said path.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hazel\">Hazel</h3>\n<p>The last and final step. The one step that unifies desktop and iOS blogging. Automatically uploading my posts from Dropbox to the server. Hazel is the perfect match for that. Especially since it got the ability to open an FTP connection on its own a couple of versions back.</p>\n<p>The Hazel flow goes like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look into the Drafts Or Editorial app folder and check if there is new post.</li>\n<li>Put the file into a subfolder called <code>&lt;date&gt;-postname</code>.</li>\n<li>Rename the file to <code>article.md</code> (the name of my Kirby layout template for a blog post)</li>\n<li>move the new folder with the post in it into my blog</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There another Hazel rule takes over as Hazel rules only ever can work on one folder at a time. It goes like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a folder? Look into it.</li>\n<li>Any file that doesn&rsquo;t have a red or grey color tag and that has been modified within the day gets uploaded</li>\n<li>After the upload color the file grey</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The color tags are there to stop Hazel from constantly uploading files that have been modified inside the &ldquo;today&rdquo; timeframe. But they also allow me to simply take off the color label if I want a file to be re-uploaded.</p>\n<p>Grab the Hazel ruleset here: <a href=\"https://alexanderkucera.com/uploads/2024/hazelrules.zip\">hazelrules.zip</a></p>\n<p>The one called <code>Drafts-Editorial-Folder</code> is for the incoming Drafts or Editorial file and the one called <code>Kirby-Blog-Folder</code> monitors the Kirby blog folder.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-it\">That&rsquo;s it.</h2>\n<p>See?

				"title": "Assembling a VFX Camera Kit",
				"content_html": "<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/239/2024/f309c8f577.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\">\n<p>I don&rsquo;t have my own camera kit specifically for VFX yet. Usually when I am on set, I either rent or get equipment from the production that is hiring me. Now I am about to build my own camera kit and to stay halfway reasonable I want to stay around €6000, though I can go over that amount to get a better kit if need be. And it looks like I might have to.</p>\n<p>I thought I&rsquo;d ask you guys for opinions on what to get and if I maybe can switch around a few things to get the most bang for my buck. Also, writing it all down is more for my benefit really, as it allows me to think through things better.</p>\n<p>The goal is to build a kit that works well in four different situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professional:\n<ul>\n<li>Set photography (making reference photos, shooting textures, making set HDRis, etc.)</li>\n<li>Panorama photography (HDRi and normal panoramas)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Personal:\n<ul>\n<li>Since I am a rather new dad (boy, 10 months) I will use the camera for child photography. He is already a speedy little guy and I only see this getting more intense as time moves on.</li>\n<li>Also, we own three ferrets who are even speedier.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So all things considered, I am looking to build a kit that serves well for kid and animal photography as well as on set photography.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-list\">The List</h2>\n<p>So far my list looks like this (all prices are not yet researched for cheapness but mostly straight off of Amazon):</p>\n<h3 id=\"cameras\">Cameras:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Canon 7D ~€1200</li>\n<li>Canon 5D Mark III ~€2600</li>\n<li>Canon 5D Mark II ~€2300</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am itching for the full frame sensor. Getting the older MK2 doesn&rsquo;t seem to make much sense as it was still rather expensive when I looked.</p>\n<p>The 7D I am unsure about. Yes, it is cheaper, but also not a full frame sensor. However, I could use the saved money to get more/better glass.</p>\n<p>Another added benefit of the less then full frame sensor is that is allows me to capture a higher resolution panorama with the 8mm Sigma at the cost of needing one or two more shots to get a full 360° panorama. So higher res, but slower workflow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lenses\">Lenses:</h3>\n<p>The options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sigma 8mm Fisheye ~€750</li>\n<li>Canon 50mm F1.2 (~€1400) or F1.4 (~€300)</li>\n<li>Canon 70-200mm f2,8 ~€1000 (without image stabilization) or -2000 (with image stabilization)</li>\n<li>Canon 70-200mm ~€1000 (or I go f4 with image stabilization)</li>\n<li>Canon 20mm f2.8 ~€450</li>\n<li>Canon EF 16-35mm 1:2,8L II USM ~€1300</li>\n<li>Sigma 35 mm f/1,4 DG HSM ~€800</li>\n<li>Canon EF 35mm 1:1,4 L USM ~€1300</li>\n<li>Canon 24-70mm f2.8 ~€2000</li>\n<li>Canon Extender EF 2x III ~€480</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am only sure about the 8mm Sigma and pretty sure I want to get a 70-200mm, but inbetween I am torn. Get a 50mm prime or a 24-70mm zoom? Maybe a 35mm? 85mm?</p>\n<p>I do like the added quality and speed of a prime lens. For my main use case, which will be professional panorama photography, I think I&rsquo;m going to go 8mm (standard, quick on-set pano HDR), 20mm (high-res on-set HDR pano) and 50mm (for those gigapanos and child photography).</p>\n<p>The 70-200mm will be used for capturing textures and general on-set photography. Still not sure if I want the added quality of the f2.8 or if the f4 with image stabilization is good enough. It is a 1000 bucks difference after all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mounts-and-tripods\">Mounts and Tripods:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Nodal Ninja with RD16 €449</li>\n<li>Manfrotto 055CXPRO4 or 190CXPRO4 ~€200 (not sure, both cost about the same. I am open for other less pricey brands as well)</li>\n<li>I already have a ball head</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This setup is pretty fixed. I like the Nodal Ninja and I have a ball head. I am open for a less expensive tripod, but given the quality of Manfrotto, €200 isn&rsquo;t too bad, really.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remotes\">Remotes:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Promote ~€380</li>\n<li>Canon tc-80n3 ~€140</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&rsquo;m unsure about the MK3&rsquo;s bracketing as it only offers 1EV steps at maximum. The Promote would allow me to control that better, but it is double of the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; (and already rather pricey) Canon remote.</p>\n<h3 id=\"all-the-other-stuff-one-needs-and-that-sucks-money-away\">All the other stuff one needs and that sucks money away:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sandisk Compact Flash Extreme 32GB 60MB/s (I really don&rsquo;t see the point of going faster then 60 MB/s I&rsquo;m not planning to do much video with it) ~€75 a pop about three or four of these</li>\n<li>Pelican card case ~€40</li>\n<li>DELOCK Card Reader-FireWire ~€50</li>\n<li>Hama Lenspen ~€12</li>\n<li>Peli 1510 Carry On Case ~€300 or a nice huge backpack that can fit all of this gear. I&rsquo;m open for suggestions here.</li>\n<li>a ruler of known length for matchmoving purposes</li>\n<li>greyball 18% grey</li>\n<li>Spyder Cube (was thinking of taking this instead of the grey ball as it is easier to get then 18% grey paint p lus it is very portable) ~€50</li>\n<li>LightCraft Variable ND Fader ND MKII ~€100</li>\n<li>B+W Cirkular Polarizer Käsemann F-Pro MRC DH 77mm ~€120</li>\n<li>Leatherman Wave ~€70</li>\n<li>X-Rite MSCCPP Passport ColorChecker ~€70</li>\n<li>Leica D2 Laser measure ~€110</li>\n<li>Bosch auto levelling laser cross ~€50</li>\n<li>Canon battery packs LP-E6 ~€50</li>\n<li>Suunto Pm-5 Clinometer ~€150</li>\n<li>various self printed lens charts and tracking markers</li>\n<li>tapes a whole bunch of them</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"software\">Software</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Aperture (which I already have)</li>\n<li>ptGUI (which I also already have)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Quite the list, eh?</p>\n<p>I think the stuff at the bottom is pretty much locked in (and already a hefty 1300 bucks price tag), but I am pretty uncertain how to balance the stuff at the top, especially lenses.</p>\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/239/2024/3c56b476eb.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"222\" alt=\"\">\n<p>I got access to my copy of <a href=\"http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun\">Shadowrun Returns</a> right on release, July 25th, and immediately ended up playing it of about five hours. Probably your first clue that I liked it.</p>\n<p>It has been described as Neverwinter Nights meets XCOM by its creators and that description is pretty accurate. I&rsquo;d add that it at times also has a little point and click adventure feel to it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"on-a-budget\">On A Budget</h2>\n<p>Harebrained Software got $1.8 Million from Kickstarter, which, when you take away all the Kickstarter and Amazon fees plus physical rewards, ends up as about $1.2 Million for the actual game. It later racked up the budget with a loan and additional Pre-sales done via their website, so I&rsquo;m assuming that the actual budget ended up in the $2 Million range again. Which sounds like a lot, but it really isn&rsquo;t if you do the math.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the developers did a remarkable job of translating the Shadowrun experience into a playable and infinitely expandable game. The environments are gorgeous, the first story that came with it is pretty solid and supposed to be about 12 hours of gameplay.</p>\n<p>You can really only tell that they needed to cut stuff by the lack of detail in the characters. They just feel a little unpolished at times. The 3D characters that is. The character art is top notch.</p>\n<p>Another thing that&rsquo;s sorely missing to give the game that extra bit of atmosphere is a voice over track. It&rsquo;s just a little lackluster to read all the dialogue. But I guess with the idea of an editor that allows you to expand the game ad infinitum, a VO track seems a little unrealistic.</p>\n<p>But in the end, <a href=\"http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun\">Shadowrun Returns</a> remains a great, atmospheric game and anyone even mildly into the Shadowrun universe owes himself to check it out.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Subtitle: Game Review</p>\n",

Thank you and enjoy diving into all the new/old content.</p>\n",
