				"title": "We've Confused Business Tools with Life Optimization",
				"content_text": " Why Personal Knowledge Management is Often Just Productivity Theater I have a confession: in my 45 years on this planet, I\u0026rsquo;ve collected an enormous amount of information. Files, bookmarks, articles, videos, notes, screenshots – you name it, I\u0026rsquo;ve probably saved it somewhere. I like the idea of knowledge managers like Logseq, Craft, and Notion. The promise is seductive: capture everything, organize it systematically, and transform into some sort of information superhuman who can recall any fact or insight at will.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the uncomfortable truth – I hardly ever revisit any of it. When I actually need to know something again, I don\u0026rsquo;t turn to my carefully curated NeoFinder database or my elaborate folder structures. I just Google it. Or search on Kagi. Or ask Perplexity. The information I need is usually just a search away, delivered faster and more accurately than I could ever dig it out of my own archives.\nThe irony of this realization hit me just this week. I recently got a 6-month subscription to Craft when I purchased a software bundle, and I\u0026rsquo;ve spent the last few days obsessively trying to find a way to fit it into my workflow. I\u0026rsquo;ve been experimenting with templates, exploring its linking features, and imagining elaborate organizational schemes for all my scattered thoughts and bookmarks. But the honest truth? I\u0026rsquo;m trying to create a need for a knowledge manager when I don\u0026rsquo;t actually need one. I\u0026rsquo;m attempting to justify a tool by inventing problems for it to solve.\nThis is productivity theater at its most seductive – the feeling of optimizing and organizing without any clear benefit. Why do I keep doing this? Why do millions of us keep building these elaborate personal knowledge management systems that we barely use? I think we\u0026rsquo;ve fallen for one of productivity culture\u0026rsquo;s most persistent lies: that we should manage our personal information like businesses manage their critical data.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a fundamental difference between the project specifications I need for work, the architectural decisions that could cost thousands if forgotten, or the client contact details that represent real relationships and revenue – and that fascinating article about medieval farming techniques I bookmarked \u0026ldquo;for later reading.\u0026rdquo; One category has real consequences. The other is just intellectual curiosity dressed up as productivity.\nYet somewhere along the way, we started treating both with the same systematic rigor. We began filing random YouTube videos like they were legal contracts. We started organizing casual reading lists like they were product roadmaps. We turned every moment of curiosity into a cataloging task, every interesting link into homework for our future selves.\nThe personal knowledge management industry has convinced us this is normal, even admirable. They\u0026rsquo;ve created beautiful tools and compelling methodologies that make the act of organizing information feel profound and important. The \u0026ldquo;Second Brain\u0026rdquo; concept sounds revolutionary until you realize that your actual brain, combined with the internet, already does this job pretty well for most things that matter in daily life.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve watched friends spend hours perfecting their Obsidian workflows, tweaking their Notion databases, and migrating between different note-taking systems in search of the perfect setup. The irony is stark: they spend more time organizing information than using it. The system becomes the goal instead of the means. It\u0026rsquo;s productivity theater – the appearance of being more organized and knowledgeable without actually becoming more effective.\nThis wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a problem if these systems were just harmless hobbies, but research suggests they\u0026rsquo;re not. Studies show that digital hoarding behaviors affect about half of all Americans and can contribute to as much as 37% of an individual\u0026rsquo;s anxiety levels. We create these elaborate information architectures, then feel guilty when we don\u0026rsquo;t maintain them, stressed when we can\u0026rsquo;t find things in them, and overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content we\u0026rsquo;ve committed to \u0026ldquo;processing someday.\u0026rdquo;\nThe anxiety is real because we\u0026rsquo;ve created artificial obligations to ourselves. Every saved article becomes a promise to read it. Every bookmarked video becomes a commitment to watch it. Every note becomes a task to review and connect to other notes. We\u0026rsquo;ve turned the simple act of encountering interesting information into a complex project management challenge.\nMeanwhile, Google has gotten incredibly good at finding information. Perplexity can synthesize answers from multiple sources instantly. Kagi delivers relevant results without the noise. The tools for real-time information discovery have become so powerful that maintaining personal archives for general knowledge often makes as much sense as keeping a home library of phone books.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s where it gets interesting: I do see the value in knowledge management for certain things. My NeoFinder database isn\u0026rsquo;t really about daily information retrieval – it\u0026rsquo;s about long-term archival of specific materials that might genuinely disappear from the internet. Project documentation at work isn\u0026rsquo;t optional; it\u0026rsquo;s how teams function and how institutional memory survives personnel changes. Client contact information and project specifications have real-world consequences if lost.\nThe difference is purpose and stakes. Work-related knowledge management serves clear, immediate needs with measurable consequences. Personal knowledge management, for most of us, serves psychological needs we don\u0026rsquo;t always acknowledge – the feeling of being prepared, the identity of being someone who \u0026ldquo;keeps track of things,\u0026rdquo; the illusion of control in an information-saturated world.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something liberating about recognizing this distinction. It means you can stop feeling guilty about not reviewing your saved articles. You can abandon that elaborate tagging system you set up but never maintain. You can let most information remain temporary, encountered and appreciated in the moment rather than preserved for an imaginary future self who will have both the time and inclination to systematically review everything you found interesting.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean becoming an information nihilist. It means being honest about what actually deserves systematic management versus what we can trust to the cloud of collective human knowledge that is the modern internet. It means recognizing that for most casual learning and curiosity, the best knowledge management system is often no system at all – just the confidence that when you need to know something again, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to find it.\nMaybe I\u0026rsquo;ll find a genuine use for Craft over the next six months, or maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll learn to be comfortable with the fact that a beautifully designed tool doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to become part of my life just because I have access to it.

				"title": "Rate Limits: The Unlikely Hero of Developer Wellness",
				"content_text": "I have to admit something embarrassing. I\u0026rsquo;ve become addicted to vibe coding.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something magical about having all the projects you can think of at your fingertips. Need a quick script? Done. Want to prototype that wild idea? Ready in minutes. Complex refactoring that would take hours? The AI handles it while I grab coffee.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the thing. Rate limits hit. The magic stops. And I get annoyed.\nThen I realized something. These rate limits might actually be saving me.\nThe Vibe Coding Addiction Vibe coding changes everything about programming. Instead of wrestling with syntax, you describe what you want. The AI translates your intentions into working code. It\u0026rsquo;s programming at the speed of thought.\nResearch shows this creates what psychologists call a \u0026ldquo;flow state.\u0026rdquo; That deep immersion where creativity peaks and time disappears. You\u0026rsquo;re not debugging semicolons. You\u0026rsquo;re orchestrating solutions.\nThe barrier to building drops to almost zero. Got an idea? Start talking to the AI. Within minutes, you have working code. The dopamine hit is immediate and powerful.\nNo wonder we get hooked.\nBut flow states have a dark side. Time becomes elastic. Hours pass like minutes. You forget to eat, drink, or move. The outside world fades away.\nThe Hidden Health Crisis Extended coding sessions wreck your body. We know this. Stiff neck, sore back, dry eyes. The usual suspects.\nBut vibe coding makes it worse. Traditional coding has natural break points. Compilation errors. Syntax mistakes. Research breaks. These interruptions force micro-recoveries.\nVibe coding removes those friction points. The AI handles the syntax. Debugging becomes conversation. You can code for hours without hitting a wall.\nYour brain doesn\u0026rsquo;t get those crucial rest moments. Cognitive overload builds. Decision fatigue sets in. You start making worse choices even as you feel more productive.\nStudies on developer wellness are clear. Regular breaks aren\u0026rsquo;t optional. They\u0026rsquo;re essential for both physical and mental health. The Pomodoro Technique exists for good reason.\nBut when the AI makes everything feel effortless, who thinks about breaks?\nRate Limits as Accidental Wellness Features This is where rate limits become heroes in disguise.\nThat frustrating message? \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve reached your rate limit. Try again later.\u0026rdquo;\nIt forces you to stop. Step away. Move around. Let your brain relax.\nI used to curse these interruptions. Now I see them differently. They\u0026rsquo;re mandatory wellness breaks. Digital interventions preventing coding binges.\nFor me, with my health condition, these forced breaks are especially crucial. I need that movement. That mental reset. Without rate limits, I\u0026rsquo;d code myself into a hole.\nThe AI companies probably didn\u0026rsquo;t design rate limits for our health. They\u0026rsquo;re managing server costs and preventing abuse. But the side effect is profound.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re protecting us from ourselves.\nThe Productivity Paradox Here\u0026rsquo;s the kicker. Recent research found that experienced developers using AI tools actually showed 19% decreased productivity on complex projects. Despite feeling 20% more productive.\nWe think we\u0026rsquo;re coding faster. But we\u0026rsquo;re not. The AI creates an illusion of speed while introducing subtle inefficiencies.\nRate limits might be saving us from more than burnout. They might be saving us from counterproductive coding sessions that feel amazing but deliver less value.\nThose forced pauses give us time to reflect. Is this code actually better? Am I solving the right problem? Sometimes the answer is no.\nEmbracing the Pause I\u0026rsquo;m learning to reframe rate limits. Instead of obstacles, they\u0026rsquo;re features. Built-in wisdom from systems that know we can\u0026rsquo;t self-regulate.\nBut we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t rely only on external limits. We need internal boundaries too.\nSet timers. Take real breaks. Go for walks. Talk to humans. Remember the world beyond the screen exists.\nThe AI will wait. Your projects will survive. Your health won\u0026rsquo;t.\nRate limits aren\u0026rsquo;t just about server resources. They\u0026rsquo;re about human resources. Your energy, focus, and wellbeing.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re reminders that even in our AI-powered future, we\u0026rsquo;re still human. We still need rest, movement, and connection.\nSo next time you hit a rate limit, don\u0026rsquo;t curse it. Thank it.\nIt might just be saving your life.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s your relationship with AI coding tools? Do you find them addictive? How do you maintain healthy coding habits? I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts.\n",

				"title": "The Unintended Side Effect of Vibe Coding",
				"content_text": "The Vibe Coding Project Explosion I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect this. Vibe coding had an unintended side effect. Blasting through little coding projects has lead to a creative influx. Now my project todo list is growing exponentially. With every project I do, two more project ideas come to mind. What was my list of growing issues on one project before is now a growing list of actual projects I want to do.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t just me being scattered. There\u0026rsquo;s actually psychology behind this phenomenon. Creative momentum breeds more creativity. When you complete projects quickly and see tangible results, your brain gets addicted to that success feeling. Each finished project exposes new possibilities. You spot connections you never saw before. Suddenly every problem looks solvable. It\u0026rsquo;s like intellectual curiosity breeding more curiosity. The more you learn, the more you realize you don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nThis is actually a good problem to have. Most people struggle with finding project ideas, not managing too many. But it\u0026rsquo;s still a problem. Analysis paralysis kicks in when you have fifty exciting projects and only twenty-four hours in a day. Your todo list becomes this overwhelming beast. You start feeling guilty about all the cool stuff you\u0026rsquo;re not building.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m learning about handling this creative overflow. Brain dump everything. Don\u0026rsquo;t keep ideas in your head. Write them down immediately. Use whatever works - notes app, paper, voice memos. One focus project at a time. This is the hardest part. Pick one project and ignore the rest until it\u0026rsquo;s done. Use the parking lot method. Keep a separate list for \u0026ldquo;someday maybe\u0026rdquo; projects. Review it monthly, but don\u0026rsquo;t let it distract from your current focus. Accept that most ideas will die. Not every idea needs to become reality. Some are just your brain playing with possibilities.\nThe truth is, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to stop this creative explosion. It feels too good to solve problems quickly and see immediate results. But I am getting better at managing it. The key is channeling that creative energy without drowning in it. If you\u0026rsquo;re experiencing the same thing, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. It\u0026rsquo;s what happens when you taste the power of rapid iteration and creative problem-solving. Just remember - finishing one great project beats starting ten mediocre ones.\nNow excuse me while I add three more project ideas to my parking lot list.\nThis article was written with the help of Claude and my own experience with the beautiful chaos of vibe coding.\n",

				"title": "Vibe Coding Isn't Code Slop - It's Strategic Collaboration",
				"content_text": "For anyone thinking \u0026ldquo;vibe coding\u0026rdquo; results in bad quality code or code slop, let me set the record straight.\nI spend about 50-70% of my vibe coding time refactoring and running code reviews to make sure everything is up to snuff. I could easily skip that step and have something that just works. But my standards are higher than that.\nThe misconception comes from people who think vibe coding means throwing prompts at an LLM and calling it a day. That\u0026rsquo;s not vibe coding. That\u0026rsquo;s just being lazy.\nWhat Vibe Coding Actually Means To me, vibe coding is more akin to being the designer or product manager while the LLM is the coder. I give it a task and once it\u0026rsquo;s done, I review the task and give it corrections and suggestions on how to improve the code and what to do next.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s never about set and forget. It\u0026rsquo;s strictly about increased productivity and accessing a knowledge base that knows more about coding than I will ever have.\nThink about it this way: when you work with a junior developer, you don\u0026rsquo;t just hand them a task and walk away. You review their work, provide feedback, suggest improvements, and guide them through iterations. The same principle applies to working with LLMs.\nThe difference? The LLM has access to patterns and solutions from millions of codebases. But it still needs human oversight to ensure quality and context.\nMy Actual Workflow Let me get specific about how this works in practice. I mainly use Claude Code, and I have it set to planning mode for most of my inputs until I\u0026rsquo;m happy with the plan Claude comes up with. Only then do I allow it to execute the plan.\nThis two-stage process is crucial. Instead of jumping straight into code generation, Claude first presents a detailed plan of what it intends to do. I can review the approach, suggest modifications, point out potential issues, or redirect entirely before a single line of code gets written.\nThis planning phase catches problems early. Maybe Claude misunderstood a requirement. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a better architectural approach. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s missing a critical edge case. Catching these issues in the planning stage saves massive amounts of time later.\nI also use an MCP server called Vibe Check and have Claude check against it regularly. It really helps to keep Claude on track throughout the development process.\nThe Vibe Check server acts like a continuous validation system. It helps ensure that Claude stays aligned with my coding standards and project requirements as we work through iterations. Think of it as a persistent memory system that reminds Claude of what we\u0026rsquo;ve established works well and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nOn top of that, I use a series of prompts that remind Claude how I like it to code and constantly update its coding guidelines along the way. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just about syntax preferences—it\u0026rsquo;s about architectural patterns, error handling approaches, testing strategies, and documentation standards.\nThe Quality Control Reality Recent research from 2024 shows why this structured approach matters. Studies found an 8-fold increase in duplicated code blocks when developers rely on AI assistance without proper review. Code churn rates have also increased dramatically, with much of the generated code being discarded shortly after creation.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t an AI problem. It\u0026rsquo;s a process problem.\nWhen I work with Claude, here\u0026rsquo;s what actually happens:\nI define the task with clear requirements Claude generates a detailed plan (not code yet) I review and refine the plan until it\u0026rsquo;s solid Claude executes the plan and generates code I review every line for logic, efficiency, and maintainability Claude runs Vibe Check validation throughout the process I provide specific feedback on improvements We iterate until the code meets my standards I run additional tests and refactoring passes This isn\u0026rsquo;t faster because I\u0026rsquo;m cutting corners. It\u0026rsquo;s faster because I\u0026rsquo;m leveraging a tool that can generate solutions I might not have considered, then applying human judgment to refine them within a structured framework.\nThe Productivity Paradox Research shows mixed results on AI coding productivity. Some studies report 26% gains for less experienced developers, while others show 19% decreases for experienced developers in complex scenarios.\nThe key difference? How you use the tool.\nLess experienced developers benefit because they\u0026rsquo;re getting exposure to patterns and solutions they haven\u0026rsquo;t seen before. Experienced developers struggle when they try to use AI for complex, context-heavy tasks that require deep understanding of existing codebases.\nBut when experienced developers use AI strategically—with proper planning phases, validation systems, and iterative refinement—the productivity gains are substantial.\nThe strategic advantage isn\u0026rsquo;t just speed. It\u0026rsquo;s access to a broader knowledge base. I can ask Claude about obscure APIs, edge cases, or optimization techniques that I might not remember or know about. Then I can evaluate and adapt those suggestions based on my experience and requirements.\nBeyond Set-and-Forget The \u0026ldquo;never set and forget\u0026rdquo; principle is crucial because it maintains the human element that makes code truly valuable.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m reviewing Claude-generated code, I\u0026rsquo;m looking for:\nLogic errors and edge cases Performance optimizations Code readability and maintainability Integration with existing systems Security considerations Future extensibility The LLM might generate functionally correct code, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand the broader context of your project, your team\u0026rsquo;s coding standards, or your long-term architectural goals.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where the human comes in. I\u0026rsquo;m not just checking if the code works. I\u0026rsquo;m ensuring it works well within the larger system.\nThe continuous prompting and guideline updates serve as a feedback loop. As we work through a project, Claude learns my specific preferences and patterns. But this learning is guided and validated by human oversight, not left to chance.\nThe Future of Developer Roles This approach fundamentally changes what it means to be a developer. Instead of spending time on routine implementations, you\u0026rsquo;re focusing on architecture, design decisions, and quality assurance.\nYou become the architect and the LLM becomes the builder. But architects don\u0026rsquo;t just hand over blueprints and disappear. They oversee construction, make adjustments, and ensure the final result meets specifications.\nThis shift requires maintaining your technical skills and architectural thinking. You need to understand code deeply enough to evaluate what the LLM produces. You need to know good patterns from bad ones. You need to understand the trade-offs in different approaches.\nThe developers who struggle with AI assistance are often those who try to use it as a replacement for their own knowledge rather than an amplifier of it.\nThe Strategic Advantage When done right, vibe coding isn\u0026rsquo;t about lowering standards. It\u0026rsquo;s about raising them.\nBecause you\u0026rsquo;re not bogged down in routine implementation details, you can focus more attention on code quality, system design, and user experience. You can explore more alternatives because the cost of prototyping is lower.\nYou can also tackle more ambitious projects because you have a force multiplier for the routine parts of development.\nBut this only works if you maintain rigorous standards for the output. The moment you start accepting \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; code because it was faster to generate, you\u0026rsquo;ve fallen into the trap that gives vibe coding a bad reputation.\nThe Bottom Line Vibe coding isn\u0026rsquo;t about replacing human judgment with AI automation. It\u0026rsquo;s about strategic collaboration where AI handles routine tasks and pattern generation while humans provide oversight, refinement, and architectural guidance.\nThe quality of your code depends on the quality of your review process, not the tool you use to generate it. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re working with an LLM or a junior developer, the principles remain the same: clear requirements, thorough review, iterative improvement, and unwavering standards.\nThe developers who succeed with AI assistance are those who understand this distinction. They\u0026rsquo;re not looking for a replacement for their skills. They\u0026rsquo;re looking for a tool that amplifies their capabilities while maintaining their responsibility for the final product.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what vibe coding really is. And when done right, it produces better code, not worse.\n",

				"content_text": "I just splurged for a Sublime Text license. It has been my workhorse for a couple of years now. I am ashamed to admit it took me this long to pay for it.\nSublime Text has this sneaky business model. You can download it and use it forever. There\u0026rsquo;s no forced expiration date. Just a gentle reminder popup that appears every few saves. \u0026ldquo;Hey, you should probably buy a license.\u0026rdquo; Click dismiss. Continue coding. It\u0026rsquo;s like having a really polite landlord who never actually demands rent.\nIn 2025, everyone talks about VS Code. It\u0026rsquo;s free, it\u0026rsquo;s powerful, but it\u0026rsquo;s also built on Electron. That means it\u0026rsquo;s slower and heavier than it needs to be. Sublime Text just works. It opens instantly. It handles large files without breaking a sweat. Then there\u0026rsquo;s the plugin ecosystem. I can transform it from a simple text editor into whatever I need. Want a debugger? There\u0026rsquo;s a plugin. Need advanced Git integration? Covered. It\u0026rsquo;s like having a Swiss Army knife that keeps growing new tools.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing about using great software for free. It starts to feel weird after a while. Every time that purchase reminder pops up, there\u0026rsquo;s this little voice in your head. \u0026ldquo;You use this thing every day. You depend on it. Maybe you should actually pay for it?\u0026rdquo; The guilt builds up slowly.\nSublime Text is made by a tiny company. They\u0026rsquo;re not backed by Microsoft or Google. They survive on license sales from people like me who eventually do the right thing. When I finally clicked \u0026ldquo;buy license,\u0026rdquo; it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just about legal compliance. It was about recognising value.\nThe license cost $99. For a tool that I use constantly and that just works without drama. I should have done this years ago. But better late than never, right?\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re reading this while dismissing that Sublime Text purchase dialog, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s time. The guilt relief alone is worth the price.\n",

				"title": "Links Gets a Complete Python Makeover 🐍",
				"content_text": "Major refactor brings JavaScript support and eliminates licensing fees.\nRemember when I told you about Links saving your stuff from the digital void? Well, it just got a complete technical overhaul.\nThe big news: Links now runs on a custom FastAPI Python implementation, ditching Kirby CMS entirely. Plus, it finally handles JavaScript-heavy sites that were previously impossible to archive.\nFrom PHP to Python The original Links was built on Kirby CMS. Great system, but it came with compromises. Licensed software means ongoing costs. PHP means working within CMS constraints. File-based content management that wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite right for archival workflows.\nSo I rebuilt it from scratch in Python.\nFastAPI replaced the entire web framework. Clean, fast, and designed for APIs from the ground up. The archiving scripts were already in Python - now everything speaks the same language.\nWhat This Actually Means No more licensing fees. Kirby required a one-time payment. FastAPI is completely open-source. Your self-hosted Links installation is now truly free.\nSlimmer codebase. Removed all the CMS bloat. No more fighting with file-based content management. No more PHP/Python context switching. Just focused Python code that does exactly what it needs to do.\nJavaScript support. The new architecture made it much easier to integrate proper browser engines. Sites that load content dynamically now archive perfectly. Single-page apps, modern e-commerce, social platforms - they all work now.\nThe Technical Evolution Before this refactor, Links would hit a wall with:\nSingle-page applications (SPAs) Modern e-commerce sites Social media platforms Complex dashboard interfaces Any site that builds content after page load Now it handles them all. The archiving process uses a proper browser engine, waits for JavaScript to execute, then captures everything. Content extraction gets the full picture. AI summaries actually have something meaningful to work with.\nStill the Same Simple Experience From your perspective, nothing changed. Share a link from iOS. Get the instant feedback. The background magic just got more powerful and more efficient.\nThe system still creates multiple archive formats. AI summaries still work. Full-text search still finds everything. But now it finds everything from sites that were previously impossible to archive properly.\nWhy This Matters This isn\u0026rsquo;t just a technical curiosity. It\u0026rsquo;s about sustainability and control.\nCost control. No licensing fees means lower barrier to entry for self-hosting. Your digital preservation tool doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on someone else\u0026rsquo;s business model.\nTechnical control. Custom FastAPI means the codebase does exactly what\u0026rsquo;s needed. No more working around CMS limitations. No more PHP/Python impedance mismatch.\nFuture-proofing. Python ecosystem means better integration with AI tools, archiving libraries, and modern web technologies. When the next big thing comes along, Links can adapt.\nProduction Ready This complete rewrite rolled out to the live system at links.alexanderkucera.de. No downtime. No lost data. No new workflows to learn.\nYour JavaScript-heavy bookmarks are no longer second-class citizens. And your self-hosted installation just got a lot more sustainable.\nThe Open Source Future With the Kirby dependency gone, Links is now completely open-source ready. No licensing complications. No vendor dependencies. Just Python code that preserves your digital discoveries.\nDigital preservation for the rest of us just got a lot more accessible.\n115 commits became a complete rewrite. Sometimes the best way forward is to rebuild from first principles.\n",

				"content_text": "We\u0026rsquo;ve all been there. You bookmark something important. Come back weeks later, link is dead. Content vanished, site changed, paywall appeared. The frustration of digital amnesia strikes again.\nI got tired of losing things I wanted to keep.\nFrom Simple Idea to Production Reality Links started as a basic bookmark manager. Just me, trying to organize my web finds. 115 commits later, it\u0026rsquo;s become a full archival system. The evolution from \u0026ldquo;nice to have\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t live without\u0026rdquo; surprised even me.\nWhat began as simple URL storage grew into something much more powerful. Each commit taught me something new about what people actually need. Not just bookmarks - real preservation.\nThe Mobile Revolution 📱 The game-changer was iOS Shortcuts integration. Now I can share from anywhere, archive automatically. Subway reading? One tap saves it. Meeting discovery? Boom, archived. Social media find? Got it.\nThe technical magic happens in two phases. You get instant feedback when you tap \u0026ldquo;Share to Links.\u0026rdquo; Meanwhile, the system spends 5-10 seconds downloading content. Background processing creates multiple archive formats. AI generates summaries. All while you move on with your day.\nNo more \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll save this later\u0026rdquo; mental notes. Just save it now, from wherever you are.\nSmart Archiving Made Simple Links doesn\u0026rsquo;t just store URLs. It understands content. AI summaries using Claude (with OpenAI fallback) extract meaning from every page. Content extraction that actually works handles even tricky sites.\nMultiple formats ensure long-term access:\nPDF archives preserve visual layout Markdown conversion creates searchable text WARC files maintain complete page context Structured metadata enables programmatic access Full-text search works across all archived content. Find that thing you saved months ago in seconds.\nThe system handles edge cases gracefully. Broken sites, missing metadata, failed AI calls - it all degrades nicely. You never lose your bookmark, even when things go wrong.\nHow Links Stands Apart The bookmark manager landscape is crowded. But Links takes a different approach than the competition.\nmymind.com uses AI for visual organization and discovery. Beautiful interface, smart tagging, visual search. But it\u0026rsquo;s cloud-hosted, subscription-based, and focused on organization over preservation. When mymind\u0026rsquo;s servers go down, your bookmarks go with them.\nDewey captures content at bookmark time. Great for preservation, but limited mobile integration. Raindrop.io offers visual bookmarking with cloud backup. LinkAce provides self-hosted monitoring with Internet Archive integration.\nLinks combines the best ideas while avoiding common pitfalls:\nFile-based storage (no database headaches) Self-hosted control (your data, your rules) Actual content preservation (not just pretty organization) Seamless mobile integration (because that\u0026rsquo;s where we live now) AI intelligence (without the subscription fees) While others focus on tags, categories, and visual discovery, Links focuses on one thing: making sure your stuff doesn\u0026rsquo;t disappear.\nThe Long-Term Vision Digital preservation shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be complicated. Regular people need tools that work without constant maintenance. Links embraces this philosophy.\nIn an era where websites vanish overnight, Links provides a personal solution. No tags, no categories, no complex workflows. Just chronological organization that makes sense. And yet, everything is still just one full-text search away.\nYour data lives in human-readable files. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats. If you want to move elsewhere, everything exports cleanly.\nThis is digital preservation for the rest of us.\nReady to Use Today Links is production-ready right now. All core features work reliably. The mobile integration is smooth. The AI summaries are helpful. The search actually finds things.\nAfter 115 commits of refinement, it\u0026rsquo;s almost ready for prime time. I still need to bundle it up for distribution.\nUntil then, you can try Links at links.alexanderkucera.de.\nLinks is open source and self-hostable. Built with Kirby CMS, Python archiving scripts, and a healthy dose of frustration with disappearing content.\n",

The energy I once had for longer writing sessions? Gone. The focus needed for those longer posts I loved crafting almost 15 years ago? Scattered.\nI\u0026rsquo;d sit down with brilliant ideas bouncing around in my head. But translating them into coherent, engaging posts felt like pushing a boulder uphill. The gap between what I wanted to say and what I could actually produce became this frustrating chasm.\nWriting stopped being joy. It became work.\nThe Unexpected Journey to AI My path to AI-assisted writing didn\u0026rsquo;t start with writing at all.\nIt began with images. MidJourney caught my attention first - the idea of creating visuals from text descriptions fascinated me. I\u0026rsquo;m a coder at heart, so the concept of prompt engineering felt natural.\nFrom there, curiosity led me to ChatGPT. Just playing around. Testing limits. Seeing what this AI thing could actually do.\nTypingMind entered the picture as a better interface for managing these AI conversations. But the real breakthrough came when I discovered Anthropic\u0026rsquo;s Claude models. Something about Claude\u0026rsquo;s responses felt more\u0026hellip; human. More collaborative.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when I started thinking: if AI can help with images and casual conversations, maybe it can help with the writing that\u0026rsquo;s become so challenging.\nWhat AI Actually Does for My Blog Here\u0026rsquo;s what people get wrong about AI writing assistance. They think it\u0026rsquo;s about replacing the writer.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not.\nFor me, AI bridges the gap between having ideas and having the energy to execute them properly. It\u0026rsquo;s like having a research assistant, writing partner, and editor all rolled into one - but one who never gets tired when I need to take breaks.\nThe AI handles the heavy lifting of research. It pulls current facts, finds relevant examples, and organizes information in ways that make sense. When writer\u0026rsquo;s block hits (and with health challenges, it hits more often), the AI helps me push through by generating different angles or approaches I hadn\u0026rsquo;t considered.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the key: I\u0026rsquo;m still driving the process. Every idea comes from me. Every direction change is my call. The AI just helps me get there without burning through the limited energy I have each day.\nSince embracing this approach, I\u0026rsquo;ve published more than I have in years. Not because I have a schedule to maintain, but because writing is enjoyable again.\nKeeping It Real Let me be crystal clear about something: if a post doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like me, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get published.\nPeriod.\nThe AI might help craft sentences or organize thoughts, but every published word has to pass my authenticity test. I work with the AI through multiple iterations, adjusting tone, refining arguments, and polishing until it genuinely feels like something I would write.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t about tricking readers or taking shortcuts. It\u0026rsquo;s about having the tools to express my actual thoughts and ideas when my body isn\u0026rsquo;t cooperating with my creative ambitions.\nThe iterative process is crucial. I\u0026rsquo;ll ask for revisions on specific paragraphs, request tone adjustments, or completely redirect sections that don\u0026rsquo;t feel right. The AI is patient in ways human collaborators might not be - it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get frustrated when I need the fifth version of the same paragraph.\nMy Current Workflow The Setup That Changed Everything\nI built my writing process around TypingMind, which lets me create specialized agents with different skills. My \u0026ldquo;Professional Blog Writer\u0026rdquo; agent is like having a writing partner who actually knows me.\nThe agent comes loaded with plugins that do the heavy lifting:\nPerplexity Search for current research and facts Sequential Thinking for structured outlines Memoryplugin to remember my writing style and preferences TubePlus for YouTube content analysis Firecrawl for web scraping when I need specific sources Image Search for visual inspiration From Idea to Published Post\nMy process is surprisingly simple now. I start with just a topic idea or maybe a short summary of what\u0026rsquo;s bouncing around in my head. Nothing fancy.\nThe AI immediately pulls up research, creates an outline, and we go back and forth until it feels right. Sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s two exchanges. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s ten. Depends on the complexity and how clear my initial thoughts were.\nThen comes the actual writing. Here\u0026rsquo;s where the Memory Plugin really shines - it usually nails my writing style on the first or second attempt because it remembers how I like things phrased, my sentence patterns, even my weird quirks.\nThe Back-and-Forth Dance\nWhen something doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel right, I\u0026rsquo;m specific: \u0026ldquo;Make this section more conversational\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;This paragraph is too formal for my voice.\u0026rdquo; The AI adjusts, and we keep refining until I hit that moment where I think, \u0026ldquo;Yes, this sounds like me.\u0026rdquo;\nThe whole thing outputs in Markdown, so I just copy-paste into my blogging software. No reformatting headaches.\nWhy This Works for Me\nThe energy I used to burn on research and first drafts now goes into the creative refinement. I\u0026rsquo;m collaborating rather than grinding. And because the AI learns my style over time, each post gets easier to perfect.\nLooking Forward The future of AI-assisted blogging isn\u0026rsquo;t about replacing writers. It\u0026rsquo;s about amplifying what they are already good at while compensating for their limitations - whether those are time, energy, health, or simply the occasional creative block.\nFor bloggers dealing with similar challenges, my advice is simple: start small. Pick one aspect of your writing process that frustrates you most and see if AI can help with that specific piece. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to revolutionize everything at once.\nThe key is maintaining control. The AI is a tool, not a replacement. Your voice, your ideas, your standards - those don\u0026rsquo;t change. What changes is having the support to express them even when life throws curveballs.\nI\u0026rsquo;m more excited about blogging now than I\u0026rsquo;ve been in years. Not because AI does the work for me, but because it helps me do the work I want to do, even when my body isn\u0026rsquo;t fully cooperating.\nAnd honestly? That\u0026rsquo;s made all the difference.\nThis post was written with the assistance of Claude AI through TypingMind, following my usual collaborative process of research, outlining, drafting, and refinement until it properly captured my voice and experience.\n",

				"content_text": "Eight weeks ago, I had open kidney surgery. After being bedridden for most of my three and a half week hospital stay, that final week felt like a triumph.\nI\u0026rsquo;d graduated from assisted walking to making it down the hospital floor and back on my own. By discharge day, I was walking the entire floor independently. I felt confident. Ready to get back to normal life.\nThat confidence lasted exactly ten meters outside the hospital.\nTen meters from my front door, I needed a thirty-second break. Just ten meters. The same distance I\u0026rsquo;d been covering easily in the hospital corridors suddenly felt impossible. After feeling so capable walking those hospital floors, I felt like I\u0026rsquo;d run a marathon.\nBy the end of that first day home, I\u0026rsquo;d managed maybe thirty or forty meters total before admitting complete defeat. The difference between hospital walking and real-world walking hit me like a wall.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand then. Hospital floors are designed for recovery. They\u0026rsquo;re flat, climate-controlled, with handrails and places to rest every few meters. The real world has curbs, uneven pavement, weather, and distances that actually matter. Walking a hospital corridor doesn\u0026rsquo;t prepare you for walking to your mailbox.\nThe medical reality is pretty straightforward, but no one really prepares you for the psychological whiplash. After weeks of bed rest followed by successful hospital walking, you think you\u0026rsquo;re ready. Then you discover that three and a half weeks of lying still, even with that final week of corridor walking, has fundamentally changed what your body can handle.\nThose first few days home were a study in humility I never wanted to take. Each day I\u0026rsquo;d try to walk a little further. Some days I managed it. Other days I didn\u0026rsquo;t. The frustrating part wasn\u0026rsquo;t just the physical limitation—it was accepting that my hospital confidence had been completely misplaced.\nI started tracking my progress. Not with meters or fancy apps, but with houses. How many houses down the street could I make it before needing a breather? Before I had to turn around? These landmarks became my measuring stick. When my confidence was shattered, making it one house further was concrete proof I was still getting better, even if it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it.\nThe breakthrough came gradually, then suddenly. Around week four post-surgery, I realized I wasn\u0026rsquo;t counting steps anymore. Week six, I was walking around the block. Week seven, I made it to the local park and back.\nYesterday, I walked 1.5 kilometers in thirty minutes without stopping once. I held a conversation the entire time. Eight weeks after surgery, four and a half weeks after that humbling ten-meter reality check.\nWhat strikes me most isn\u0026rsquo;t just the physical progress. It\u0026rsquo;s how hospital walking creates false confidence that real-world recovery quickly corrects. Before surgery, walking was just transportation. Now it\u0026rsquo;s proof that my body works outside controlled environments. Each step feels like a small victory over both the surgery and that initial confidence crash.\nThe research says most open surgery patients don\u0026rsquo;t hit these milestones until week ten or twelve, especially after extended hospital stays. That feels good to hear, but it also makes me realize how misleading hospital walking can be. Your real recovery timeline starts when you leave the building.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re starting your own walking recovery after major surgery and hospitalization, here\u0026rsquo;s what I wish someone had told me. Hospital walking is just the beginning. Don\u0026rsquo;t let that final week of corridor confidence fool you into thinking you\u0026rsquo;re ready for the real world. You\u0026rsquo;re not, and that\u0026rsquo;s completely normal.\nTrack everything once you\u0026rsquo;re home. Write down distances, times, how you felt. After that initial confidence crash, the numbers become your proof of progress when your brain tells you you\u0026rsquo;re moving backwards.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t compare your home walking to your hospital walking. They\u0026rsquo;re completely different activities requiring different energy levels and skills. Hospital floors are recovery training wheels. Real-world walking is the actual test.\nConsistency beats intensity every single time. I walked every day after discharge, even if it was just to the mailbox. Those tiny daily efforts compound faster than sporadic longer attempts. Your body needs to relearn movement in real environments, not just controlled hospital corridors.\nBad days will happen. Last week I had a terrible walking day where everything felt harder than usual. I questioned whether I was actually improving or just fooling myself. The next day I walked further than ever before. Recovery after that kind of confidence crash isn\u0026rsquo;t linear.\nThe mental side of this recovery taught me things I never expected to learn. Humility, for one. Hospital walking had made me feel capable. Real-world walking reminded me I was still healing. Both were necessary parts of the process.\nIt also taught me to celebrate ridiculously small victories. Making it to the corner without stopping. Walking up three stairs without getting winded. Holding a conversation while moving. After that ten-meter wake-up call, these became genuine achievements worth acknowledging.\nLooking ahead, I\u0026rsquo;m still technically in the recovery window. Open surgery patients don\u0026rsquo;t hit full recovery until month three. That means I\u0026rsquo;ve got another month of potential improvement ahead of me. The thought is both exciting and surreal.\nMy new goal is two kilometers by week ten. Then maybe three by month three. But honestly, I\u0026rsquo;m less focused on the numbers now. The real victory is that walking feels normal again, even outside hospital corridors.\nRecovery from major surgery isn\u0026rsquo;t just about getting back to where you were. It\u0026rsquo;s about developing a completely different appreciation for what your body can do in real environments, not just controlled ones. Every day I can walk 1.5 kilometers is a day I don\u0026rsquo;t take for granted.\nEight weeks ago, that confident hospital walking meant nothing when faced with ten real meters. Today, 1.5 kilometers feels routine. That\u0026rsquo;s not just physical healing—that\u0026rsquo;s rebuilding trust with your own body one step at a time, in the real world.\nThis post documents my personal recovery experience. Always follow your doctor\u0026rsquo;s specific instructions for post-surgery activity and recovery timelines.\n",

				"title": "The Productivity Conversation I Didn't Expect to Have",
				"content_text": "I sat down to write about productivity. Instead, I accidentally solved my productivity problem.\nIt started with a simple request. I wanted to turn my struggles with overwhelm and chronic illness into a blog post. Multiple interests pulling me in different directions, dialysis eating up twelve hours a week, YouTube consumption replacing creation - the usual productivity paradox.\nYou read more about it here.\nBut something unexpected happened during the conversation with my AI writing assistant. What began as research for a blog post became a real-time case study in how productive conversations actually work.\nThe Original Problem The setup was familiar to anyone who\u0026rsquo;s ever felt overwhelmed by their own interests. I love coding, cooking, RPGs, fitness, reading. My wife has projects that need my support. I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to be working on an iPad app for her. But instead of making progress on any of it, I find myself watching YouTube videos for hours.\nI\u0026rsquo;d even found a video that perfectly explained the problem - how our brains get hijacked by consumption, how creation provides more sustainable dopamine hits, how shifting from consumer to contributor changes everything.\nThe Habit that forces your brain to stop consuming\nI understood the theory. I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t implement it.\nThe Conversation That Changed Everything \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s your top priority right then?\u0026rdquo; came the question.\n\u0026ldquo;Probably the iPadOS app, since finishing that would help my wife greatly.\u0026rdquo;\nSimple question. Clear answer. But then something interesting happened.\n\u0026ldquo;Those twelve hours of dialysis per week? That\u0026rsquo;s actually prime iPad development time. You could queue up iOS tutorials, work on app wireframes\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, there\u0026rsquo;s no Xcode for iPad,\u0026rdquo; I replied. \u0026ldquo;And my left arm is completely blocked with needles. I can\u0026rsquo;t move it.\u0026rdquo;\nSudden silence. Then: \u0026ldquo;Right, of course there\u0026rsquo;s no Xcode for iPad. That was a pretty big oversight on my part.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat Made This Conversation Different Most productivity advice fails because it\u0026rsquo;s generic. It assumes everyone has the same constraints, the same energy levels, the same physical capabilities. The conversation became productive the moment my real constraints got acknowledged.\nNo judgment about not being able to code one-handed during medical treatment. No generic advice about \u0026ldquo;just managing your time better.\u0026rdquo; Instead: \u0026ldquo;What can you realistically do one-handed on an iPad for four hours?\u0026rdquo;\nThe questions kept getting more specific:\n\u0026ldquo;What does your energy level look like after dialysis?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;When are you actually at your Mac with both arms free?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What makes this app section so complicated?\u0026rdquo; Each question revealed another layer of reality that typical productivity advice ignores.\nThe Lessons Hidden in the Dialogue Assumptions get corrected quickly. The Xcode-on-iPad suggestion was wrong, but it got corrected immediately instead of becoming the foundation for useless advice.\nConstraints clarify priorities. Once we established that dialysis time wasn\u0026rsquo;t coding time, it became clear that the real development work had to happen during my four productive in-between days.\nSpecificity beats generality. \u0026ldquo;Work on the app\u0026rdquo; is overwhelming. \u0026ldquo;Identify the next three concrete actions for the app\u0026rdquo; is actionable.\nQuestions matter more than answers. The breakthrough didn\u0026rsquo;t come from advice. It came from questions that helped me see my situation more clearly.\nThe Meta-Lesson Here\u0026rsquo;s what I realized: the conversation itself was demonstrating the productivity principle I needed to learn.\nInstead of consuming more productivity content, I was actively working through my specific situation. Instead of generic advice, I was getting targeted questions. Instead of feeling judged for my limitations, I was finding ways to work with them.\nThe conversation was creation, not consumption. It was collaborative problem-solving in real time.\nThe Breakthrough Moment The real breakthrough came when we identified that the missing section of the app wasn\u0026rsquo;t just technically complicated - it was \u0026ldquo;lots of different pieces.\u0026rdquo; Suddenly the overwhelm made sense. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t one elegant problem to solve, but fifteen mini-features that all needed to connect.\n\u0026ldquo;What if you just listed all the different pieces first? Not designing them, not coding them - just creating an inventory.\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when it clicked. The paralysis wasn\u0026rsquo;t about not knowing how to code. It was about not knowing where to start when everything felt connected to everything else.\nWhat This Means for Productivity The best productivity hack might be finding someone who asks better questions.\nNot someone who gives you a system to follow. Not someone who tells you to eliminate distractions. Someone who helps you see your actual constraints clearly, then works with those constraints instead of ignoring them.\nGeneric productivity advice is like generic medical advice - it might work for some people, but it\u0026rsquo;s useless if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t account for your specific situation.\nThe real productivity breakthrough happens when you stop trying to fit your life into someone else\u0026rsquo;s system and start building a system that fits your actual life.\nThe Ironic Ending I started this conversation wanting to write about my productivity problems. I ended up actually solving them.\nThe blog post was supposed to be about the problem. Instead, it became about the solution.\nSometimes the most productive thing you can do is have a better conversation.\n",

				"title": "Pulled in Too Many Directions: When Chronic Illness Meets Creative Overwhelm",
				"content_text": "I spent four hours yesterday watching YouTube videos about productivity.\nThe irony wasn\u0026rsquo;t lost on me. There I was, consuming content about being productive instead of actually being productive. But here\u0026rsquo;s the thing - I wasn\u0026rsquo;t just being lazy. I was overwhelmed.\nI have too many interests that all matter to me. I love to code. There\u0026rsquo;s something magical about writing text and making computers do things. I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to be working on an iPadOS app for my wife.\nI love cooking, which means meal planning and grocery shopping - two huge time sucks.\nI like working out, though I rarely do it anymore.\nRoleplaying games fascinate me. I want to set up the next adventure for friends.\nMy wife has her own projects that need my support. Then there\u0026rsquo;s my reading backlog - books, stories, technical manuals.\nOh, and I spend twelve hours a week getting dialysis.\nThe Multi-Interest Trap Most productivity advice assumes your interests are frivolous. \u0026ldquo;Just eliminate the time-wasters,\u0026rdquo; they say. \u0026ldquo;Focus on what matters.\u0026rdquo;\nBut what if everything matters?\nCoding isn\u0026rsquo;t just a hobby - it\u0026rsquo;s creative problem-solving that feeds my soul. Cooking isn\u0026rsquo;t just sustenance - it\u0026rsquo;s how I care for my family. RPGs aren\u0026rsquo;t escapism - they\u0026rsquo;re collaborative storytelling that connects me with friends. Reading isn\u0026rsquo;t procrastination - it\u0026rsquo;s how I learn and grow.\nThe problem isn\u0026rsquo;t having meaningless hobbies. The problem is having too many meaningful ones.\nTraditional productivity gurus don\u0026rsquo;t account for this. They assume you\u0026rsquo;re scrolling TikTok for hours, not trying to choose between legitimate creative pursuits. When all your interests have value, choosing becomes paralyzing.\nThe Chronic Illness Factor Then there\u0026rsquo;s the reality most productivity advice ignores completely: chronic illness.\nI spend four hours, three days a week, lying in a bed with needles in my left arm. I can\u0026rsquo;t move that arm. I can\u0026rsquo;t use both hands. I\u0026rsquo;m physically constrained in ways that make traditional \u0026ldquo;hustle culture\u0026rdquo; advice feel like a cruel joke.\nMy energy fluctuates wildly. Some afternoons after dialysis, I feel energetic. Other days, I\u0026rsquo;m completely drained. The days between treatments are usually my most productive, but that\u0026rsquo;s only four days a week at full capacity.\nMost productivity experts have never had to plan their creative work around medical treatments. They\u0026rsquo;ve never had to factor in recovery time or energy management. Their advice assumes consistent daily energy levels that simply don\u0026rsquo;t exist for people like me.\nThe Consumption Trap This is where YouTube becomes dangerous.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re tired, when you\u0026rsquo;re overwhelmed by choices, when you\u0026rsquo;re physically limited, consumption becomes the path of least resistance. Watching someone else code feels productive without requiring the energy that actual coding demands. Food videos scratch the cooking itch without the meal planning overhead.\nI recently watched a video that hit hard (see The Habit that forces your brain to stop consuming). The creator talked about how our brains crave novelty and dopamine, and social media provides artificial hits of both. But creation provides them in more sustainable, meaningful doses.\nThe insight was powerful: shift from being a consumer to being a contributor.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what the video didn\u0026rsquo;t address - what happens when your ability to contribute is limited by physical constraints? What happens when you have the drive to create but not always the energy or physical capacity?\nAdapted Strategies The solution isn\u0026rsquo;t to eliminate interests or ignore physical limitations. It\u0026rsquo;s to work smarter with the energy and time you actually have.\nWork with your energy patterns, not against them. My most productive days are the in-between days. Instead of feeling guilty about low-energy days, I\u0026rsquo;ve started planning for them. Dialysis days are for rest, planning, and light consumption that feeds future creation.\nBatch similar activities. Meal planning happens on Sundays. Coding happens in focused blocks on high-energy days. RPG prep gets batched with other reading activities.\nCombine interests strategically. What if I coded tools for my RPG campaigns? What if I built meal planning apps? What if I listened to coding podcasts while prepping ingredients?\nMake consumption serve creation. Instead of random YouTube videos, I queue up content that feeds my active projects. iOS development tutorials during dialysis recovery time. Cooking videos during meal planning sessions.\nUse constraints to make decisions. The physical limitation of one-handed iPad use during dialysis actually clarifies what activities are possible. The energy limitation of post-dialysis afternoons helps prioritize what matters most.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Not About Choosing Less The traditional productivity advice of \u0026ldquo;just focus on one thing\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t work when you\u0026rsquo;re a creative person with multiple meaningful interests. And it definitely doesn\u0026rsquo;t work when chronic illness adds layers of complexity to your energy management.\nThe real solution is learning to work with your constraints instead of fighting them. Your limitations aren\u0026rsquo;t failures - they\u0026rsquo;re data points that help you make better decisions about how to spend your energy.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still working on this. Some days I still end up in YouTube rabbit holes instead of making progress on projects that matter. But I\u0026rsquo;m getting better at recognizing when that\u0026rsquo;s happening and why.\nThe goal isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect productivity. It\u0026rsquo;s sustainable creativity within the reality of the life you actually have, not the life productivity gurus assume you\u0026rsquo;re living.\nSometimes the most productive thing you can do is take a nap.\n",

				"title": "Why Call of Cthulhu Beats D\u0026D at Actually Getting Played",
				"content_text": "Let\u0026rsquo;s be honest about something. How many D\u0026amp;D campaigns have you started that never finished?\nI\u0026rsquo;m talking about those epic adventures that were supposed to take your characters from level 1 to 20. The ones that petered out somewhere around level 6. The campaign notes gathering dust on your hard drive.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a reason for this. And it\u0026rsquo;s not that your group lacks commitment.\nThe Year-Long D\u0026amp;D Commitment Problem Here\u0026rsquo;s what nobody tells you when you crack open that shiny new D\u0026amp;D adventure book. Curse of Strahd will eat 22-26 sessions of your life. Tomb of Annihilation demands 26-35 sessions. Even the humble Lost Mines of Phandelver - the \u0026ldquo;beginner\u0026rdquo; adventure - clocks in at 30-50 hours of gameplay.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 6 months to 2 years of regular weekly sessions. For one campaign.\nThink about your last group text trying to schedule a session. Now imagine doing that every week for two years straight. While keeping the same characters alive. And remembering what happened in session 12 when you\u0026rsquo;re now on session 31.\nNo wonder most D\u0026amp;D campaigns die a slow death around the third month.\nCoC: Complete Stories in Bite-Sized Chunks Call of Cthulhu takes a completely different approach. Most scenarios are designed to wrap up in 3-4 hours total.\nNot 3-4 hours per session for months on end. Three to four hours. Period. Done. Complete story with beginning, middle, and satisfying conclusion.\n\u0026ldquo;The Haunting\u0026rdquo; - the classic starter scenario - takes about 4-6 hours. You can literally run this on a Saturday afternoon and have investigators discover cosmic horror, face an impossible choice, and either save the day or go insane trying. All before dinner.\nCompare that to starting Curse of Strahd knowing you\u0026rsquo;re signing up for half a year of consistent scheduling. Which one sounds more doable for your actual life?\nWhy D\u0026amp;D Became a Commitment Sport Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong. D\u0026amp;D\u0026rsquo;s design isn\u0026rsquo;t accidental. The level 1-20 progression system demands long story arcs. You need time to grow from \u0026ldquo;I swing my sword\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;I cast Meteor Swarm and reshape the battlefield.\u0026rdquo;\nPublished D\u0026amp;D adventures are built around this. They\u0026rsquo;re designed as months-long investments. Epic journeys that require sustained character development and party dynamics.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the thing. Somewhere along the way, the hobby developed this expectation that \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; D\u0026amp;D means year-long campaigns. That shorter adventures are just warm-ups for the main event.\nThis turned D\u0026amp;D into a commitment sport. Like training for a marathon when you just wanted to go for a jog.\nThe Beautiful Efficiency of Horror Call of Cthulhu works differently because horror works differently.\nInvestigation has a natural story structure. Investigators find clues. Clues lead to revelations. Revelations lead to confrontation with cosmic horror. Confrontation leads to resolution (or madness).\nThis arc fits perfectly into 3-4 hours. The tension builds, reaches a climax, and resolves. No need for seventeen sessions of character development. The story is the star, not the character sheet.\nPlus, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about character mortality. In CoC, investigators die. Or go insane. Or both. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a bug - it\u0026rsquo;s a feature. It creates natural endpoints to stories.\nUnlike D\u0026amp;D, where characters grow stronger and more attached over dozens of sessions, CoC investigators are fragile. This makes shorter commitments not just possible, but inevitable.\nReal Talk: What This Means for Your Gaming Group You know what\u0026rsquo;s great about running \u0026ldquo;The Haunting\u0026rdquo; on a Saturday night? Everyone leaves satisfied. Complete story. Full experience. No cliffhangers requiring next week\u0026rsquo;s session to resolve.\nCompare that to starting Descent into Avernus and knowing you\u0026rsquo;re committing to 30-40 sessions. That\u0026rsquo;s almost a year of weekly gaming. Miss a few sessions and you\u0026rsquo;re lost. Have one player move away and the whole campaign crumbles.\nCoC scenarios are perfect for:\nGroups with busy schedules Players who want variety in their gaming Anyone who\u0026rsquo;s tired of unfinished campaigns New players who don\u0026rsquo;t want to commit to months of sessions You can run \u0026ldquo;The Dead Boarder\u0026rdquo; in 2 hours. \u0026ldquo;The Necropolis\u0026rdquo; takes 1-2 hours max. These aren\u0026rsquo;t abbreviated experiences - they\u0026rsquo;re complete horror stories with full narrative arcs.\nReady to Try Some Cosmic Horror? If you\u0026rsquo;re tired of D\u0026amp;D campaigns that never reach their conclusions, give Call of Cthulhu a shot.\nStart with \u0026ldquo;The Haunting\u0026rdquo; from the starter set. Four hours. Complete experience. Your players will face cosmic horror, make impossible choices, and either triumph or face the consequences of meddling with forces beyond human comprehension.\nAll in one evening.\nThe best part? When it\u0026rsquo;s over, it\u0026rsquo;s actually over. Your group will have experienced a complete story from beginning to end. No scheduling next week\u0026rsquo;s session to find out what happens. No wondering if this campaign will join the graveyard of unfinished adventures.\nJust the satisfaction of a story well told. And maybe, just maybe, investigators who lived to tell the tale.\nThough honestly, where\u0026rsquo;s the fun in that?\nHave you experienced the curse of unfinished D\u0026amp;D campaigns? Or found success with shorter RPG formats? Share your horror stories (gaming or otherwise) in the comments below.\n",

				"title": "Trading Freedom for Efficiency: My Journey from PD to HD",
				"content_text": "After my kidney surgery, everything changed. I had to switch from peritoneal dialysis (PD) to hemodialysis (HD). PD is the type where you dialyze at home through your abdomen. HD is what most people picture - sitting in a clinic hooked to a machine.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t have a choice in this. The surgery made the decision for me.\nWhat I Miss Most About PD I miss my nights. With PD, I just hooked up before bed. The machine worked while I slept. Eight hours of gentle, continuous cleaning. No alarms, no nurses, no commute.\nI could roll over. I could get up for water. I could live.\nNow that freedom is gone. PD was like a gentle stream cleaning my blood all night. HD feels like a pressure washer blasting through me. Both work, but one lets you forget you\u0026rsquo;re sick.\nUnderstanding Ultrafiltration Let me explain ultrafiltration. It\u0026rsquo;s just a fancy word for removing extra fluid. Your kidneys normally do this when you pee. Dialysis has to do it artificially.\nWith PD, I could remove about twice as much fluid. The peritoneum - that\u0026rsquo;s your abdominal lining - acts like a filter. Glucose in the dialysis fluid pulls water from your blood. It\u0026rsquo;s osmosis, really.\nHD uses pressure instead. It forces fluid out through an artificial membrane. It works, but there\u0026rsquo;s a limit. Push too hard and you cramp. Your blood pressure drops. You feel awful.\nThe HD Reality Four hours. That\u0026rsquo;s what HD demands from me. Four hours of complete stillness every two days.\nTry lying perfectly still for four hours. Your arm with the needles can\u0026rsquo;t move. One wrong shift and alarms scream. Blood might leak. The nurses rush over.\nMy back aches after two hours. My legs want to stretch. My mind goes crazy with boredom. I watch the clock like it\u0026rsquo;s my enemy.\nSome people sleep through it. I can\u0026rsquo;t. I just lie there, waiting.\nWhat HD Does Better I have to be fair here. HD removes phosphate and potassium like a champion. These minerals build up when your kidneys fail. Too much potassium stops your heart. Too much phosphate destroys your bones.\nHD clears them efficiently. Three times a week, boom - levels drop. With PD, it was always a struggle. I took binders with every meal. I avoided certain foods.\nSo yes, HD has its advantages. But at what cost?\nThe Trade-Off I\u0026rsquo;d Make Give me back my PD tomorrow. I\u0026rsquo;ll take the phosphate binders. I\u0026rsquo;ll skip the bananas and potatoes. I\u0026rsquo;ll manage the potassium myself.\nWhat good is efficient toxin removal if it steals your life? I\u0026rsquo;d rather have good days with some dietary restrictions. HD gives me perfect labs and exhausting treatment days.\nQuality of life matters. Being able to work matters. Traveling without planning around clinics matters. Sleeping in your own bed every night matters.\nI\u0026rsquo;d make that trade in a heartbeat.\nLooking Forward My doctors say I might return to PD eventually. The surgical site needs to heal completely first. I\u0026rsquo;m counting the days.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re choosing between PD and HD, think beyond the medical numbers. Consider your lifestyle. Value your independence. Ask about all your options.\nHD works well for many people. Some prefer the structure. Some like not managing their own care. That\u0026rsquo;s valid too.\nBut for me? I just want my nights back. I want to wake up dialyzed, not exhausted. I want treatment that fits my life, not life that fits my treatment.\nUntil then, I\u0026rsquo;ll endure my four-hour sessions. I\u0026rsquo;ll appreciate what HD does well. But I\u0026rsquo;ll keep hoping for the day I can go home again.\nRemember: every patient is different. What works for me might not work for you. Always discuss your options with your nephrologist.\n",

				"title": "Relax History AI: When AI Brings History to Life",
				"content_text": "Ever wondered what George Washington really looked like? Not the stiff painting version, but the actual person?\nWhat if you could see Marie Curie\u0026rsquo;s actual face? Not just that famous black-and-white photo. Her real, living face with all its expressions.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s exactly what Relax History AI does. And it\u0026rsquo;s brilliant.\nWhat is Relax History AI? It\u0026rsquo;s a YouTube channel that brings dead people back to life. Well, sort of.\nThey use AI to transform old paintings and descriptions into photorealistic faces. Suddenly, historical figures aren\u0026rsquo;t just names in textbooks. They\u0026rsquo;re people. Real people with eyes that seem to look right at you.\nThe channel creates videos that reimagine everyone from Geronimo to Anastasia Romanov. Each face tells a story. Each image makes history feel closer.\nThe Magic Behind the Screen Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works. The AI analyzes everything available about a historical figure. Paintings, sketches, written descriptions. Even details about their ethnicity and the time period.\nThen it creates what they probably looked like. Not cartoon versions. Not idealized portraits. Just people.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like time travel without the paradoxes.\nThe technology adds subtle details too. Skin texture, natural lighting, realistic hair. These aren\u0026rsquo;t Instagram filters. This is serious reconstruction work.\nWhy This is a Brilliant Use of AI Most AI applications feel cold. This one creates connection.\nThink about it. We learn history through dusty portraits and formal paintings. Everyone looks stern. Everyone looks distant. No wonder kids find history boring.\nBut show them what Cleopatra might have really looked like? Now you\u0026rsquo;ve got their attention.\nThis democratizes history in ways textbooks never could. You don\u0026rsquo;t need a PhD to feel connected to these figures. You just need eyes and curiosity.\nIt also preserves cultural memory differently. Not through static images. Through faces that feel alive.\nHit Series That Changed Everything Their \u0026ldquo;20 Historical Icons Brought Back to Life\u0026rdquo; series went viral. For good reason.\nEach episode features multiple historical figures. George Washington looks less like a dollar bill and more like your stern grandfather. Anastasia Romanov becomes a real teenager, not just a tragic legend.\nMarie Curie? She looks brilliant and tired. Exactly how you\u0026rsquo;d expect someone who discovered radium to look.\nGeronimo stares back with intensity that no painting captured. You understand why he was such a formidable leader.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just pictures. They\u0026rsquo;re windows into real lives.\nThe Future of Learning History This is what good AI looks like. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t replace human connection. It creates it.\nImagine history classes using this technology. Students could \u0026ldquo;meet\u0026rdquo; the people they\u0026rsquo;re studying. The American Revolution becomes less abstract when you can see Washington\u0026rsquo;s actual face.\nTeachers could show that historical figures were just people. They had bad hair days. They had worry lines. They looked tired sometimes.\nIt changes everything about how we relate to the past.\nSome Final Thoughts Sure, these reconstructions aren\u0026rsquo;t perfect. We can\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what these people looked like. But that\u0026rsquo;s not really the point.\nThe point is connection. The point is making history human again.\nWhen you see Cleopatra as a real person, not just an Elizabeth Taylor movie, something shifts. History stops being about dates and starts being about people.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the real magic here. Not the AI technology itself. But what it helps us see.\nDead people were once alive. They had faces. They had expressions. They were just like us.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what makes Relax History AI such a great use of artificial intelligence. It makes the artificial feel human.\nHave you checked out any of their videos yet? Which historical figure would you most like to see brought to life?\n",

				"title": "The TACO Revolution: When Fast Food Meets Politics",
				"content_text": "Trump Always Chickens Out - A Spicy New Internet Sensation It seems the internet has found its newest obsession, and surprisingly, it involves both politics and Mexican cuisine – sort of. The acronym \u0026ldquo;TACO\u0026rdquo; has been taking over Facebook feeds faster than you can say \u0026ldquo;guacamole,\u0026rdquo; but this particular taco comes with an extra side of political satire.\nTACO stands for \u0026ldquo;Trump Always Chickens Out,\u0026rdquo; a term originally coined by a Financial Times columnist that has now morphed into a full-blown meme phenomenon. The internet, being the internet, couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist the delicious wordplay opportunities.\nWhy TACO is on the Menu Like any good taco, this meme comes with layers:\nThe Shell: A crispy exterior of seemingly tough talk The Filling: A soft interior of policy reversals and backtracking The Hot Sauce: Added spice when Trump himself reacted to a reporter\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;nasty\u0026rdquo; question about it The beauty of the TACO meme is that it\u0026rsquo;s both a noun and a verb. \u0026ldquo;Did you see Trump TACO on that trade policy again?\u0026rdquo; has become the new way to describe someone who talks tough but retreats when challenged.\nFrom Drive-Thru to Viral Drive What makes this political fast food so addictive? Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s the perfect combination of simplicity and substance. In a world of complex political discourse, sometimes all you need is a simple acronym that people can sink their teeth into.\nAs one Facebook user eloquently put it: \u0026ldquo;I used to enjoy Taco Tuesday, but now I enjoy TACO every day of the week.\u0026rdquo;\nWhatever your political appetite, you have to admire the internet\u0026rsquo;s ability to wrap complex political commentary in a convenient, hand-held meme format. It\u0026rsquo;s political fast food for the digital age – quick, satisfying, and guaranteed to leave a lasting impression.\nJust remember, unlike actual tacos, this one seems to have no problem holding everything together.\nDisclaimer: This blog post contains 100% organic humor with no artificial outrage.

				"content_text": "When Bromance Meets Reality TV Drama in the Age of Electric Vehicles In what future historians will surely call \u0026ldquo;The Most 2025 Thing Ever,\u0026rdquo; the Trump-Musk friendship has imploded more spectacularly than a SpaceX test rocket. Grab your popcorn, folks – this billionaire breakup has everything: Tesla tantrums, Twitter tirades, and stock market drama.\nThe Rise and Fall of an Unlikely Bromance Remember when Trump and Musk were the dynamic duo nobody saw coming? It feels like yesterday they were finishing each other\u0026rsquo;s tweets and making government efficiency memes together. But as we\u0026rsquo;ve learned from every reality TV show ever (and Trump should know this better than anyone), alliances built on shared enemies rarely survive success.\nThe partnership that began with such promise – Musk heading up the Department of Government Efficiency (yes, DOGE, because apparently we\u0026rsquo;re living in a simulation programmed by memelords) – has now devolved into a public spat that makes celebrity divorces look like amicable conscious uncouplings.\nThe Tesla Tantrum That Broke the Internet Breaking: Man who bought $100,000+ friendship token now considering regifting it. More at 11.\nIn what might be the most expensive \u0026ldquo;take back\u0026rdquo; in friendship history, Trump is reportedly considering selling or giving away the red Tesla he purchased earlier this year to support Musk. It\u0026rsquo;s like returning a friendship bracelet, but with a six-figure price tag and autopilot features.\n\u0026ldquo;Trump saying Musk has \u0026rsquo;lost his mind\u0026rsquo; is particularly rich, considering both men are known for their\u0026hellip; let\u0026rsquo;s say \u0026lsquo;unconventional\u0026rsquo; social media presence.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Irony Olympics: Gold Medal Moments 1. The DOGE Disaster 🐕 Musk\u0026rsquo;s Department of Government Efficiency was supposed to streamline government operations. Instead, it seems to have streamlined the path to their friendship\u0026rsquo;s demise. The irony is so thick you could cut it with a Cybertruck\u0026rsquo;s angular edges.\n2. The \u0026ldquo;Lost His Mind\u0026rdquo; Proclamation 🤯 Trump declaring that someone else has \u0026ldquo;lost their mind\u0026rdquo; is like a fish complaining about someone being wet. The pot hasn\u0026rsquo;t just met the kettle; they\u0026rsquo;re having a full-blown Twitter war.\n3. The Stock Market Side-Eye 📉 Tesla shares dropping 14% during their feud is essentially Wall Street\u0026rsquo;s way of saying, \u0026ldquo;Can you two just get along? Some of us have retirement portfolios!\u0026rdquo; The market has spoken, and it\u0026rsquo;s begging for couple\u0026rsquo;s therapy.\n💡 Fun Fact: The Timeline of Doom\nEarly 2025: Trump buys red Tesla, friendship rings exchanged (metaphorically) Spring 2025: DOGE launches, memes abound, efficiency promised June 2025: Public feud erupts, accusations fly, Tesla considered for donation Future: Netflix documentary inevitable What This Means for the Rest of Us Mortals Beyond the entertainment value (which, let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, is substantial), this feud represents something more significant: the collision of tech billionaire culture with political reality TV drama. It\u0026rsquo;s what happens when you mix Silicon Valley\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;move fast and break things\u0026rdquo; with Washington\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;tweet fast and break relationships.\u0026rdquo;\nThe implications are real:\nTesla stockholders are getting a masterclass in why company valuations shouldn\u0026rsquo;t depend on CEO friendships Government efficiency efforts are learning that you can\u0026rsquo;t DOGE your way out of personality conflicts Twitter (or X, or whatever we\u0026rsquo;re calling it these days) is getting record engagement from rubberneckers The Silver Lining: Comedy Gold If there\u0026rsquo;s one thing we can count on in 2025, it\u0026rsquo;s that when two of the world\u0026rsquo;s most powerful and controversial figures have a public falling out, the memes will be legendary. From Tesla return policies to DOGE efficiency jokes, the internet has been feasting on this drama like it\u0026rsquo;s a unlimited buffet of absurdity.\nThe Bottom Line The Trump-Musk feud of 2025 will go down in history as either the moment when billionaire bromances jumped the shark, or the greatest reality TV crossover event of all time. Either way, we\u0026rsquo;re all watching, tweeting, and wondering if this is what peak 2025 looks like.\nAs for Trump\u0026rsquo;s red Tesla? Maybe it\u0026rsquo;ll end up in a museum someday, with a plaque reading: \u0026ldquo;Artifact from the Great Billionaire Breakup of 2025 – Handle with Care, May Contain Traces of Irony.\u0026rdquo;\nLet’s see where this goes. In the meantime, maybe check your Tesla stock holdings. Just saying. 🚗💔📱\n(This article was written in parts with the help of Claude Opus 4.)\n",

Deshalb fordern wir die demokratischen Parteien auf, eine umfassende Pflegereform zu einem der zentralen Vorhaben in ihren Wahlprogrammen zu machen – und in der nächsten Bundesregierung ernsthaft umzusetzen.\nUnsere Forderungen – eine umfassende Pflegereform muss folgende Punkte beinhalten:\nPflegende Angehörige absichern: Pflegende Angehörige müssen wirtschaftlich, auch im Rentenalter, besser abgesichert werden. Das kann durch Maßnahmen wie eine Lohnersatzleistung und zusätzliche Rentenpunkte erreicht werden.\nPflegebedürftige und ihre Angehörigen unterstützen: Der Zugang zu Leistungen der Pflegeversicherung muss übersichtlicher und einfacher werden. Auch so können die An- und Zugehörigen vor Überlastung geschützt werden.\nFinanzierung sichern: Alle Menschen müssen sich gute Pflege leisten und dafür berechenbare Eigenvorsorge treffen können. Durch eine Pflege-Vollversicherung statt der heutigen „Teilkasko“ müssen Pflegebedürftige vor unwägbaren finanziellen Risiken geschützt werden.\n",

Replacing something very fast — password autofill — with something slower is just a terrible idea. For people who actually prefer email magic links, it’s fine as an option, but it shouldn’t be the default, and it certainly shouldn’t be the only way to sign into an account.\nI have to agree. Magic links are more annoying then helpful. I‘d like them to be an option and not the norm.

				"title": "My Current Setup",
				"content_text": "I thought I’d write down my current workflow setup since it has changed drastically since I last wrote about it. Not only am I exclusively working from home these days—due to health reasons—but I am also working in a very reduced capacity. This means I am mostly using my iPhone, iPad, and iMac for leisure.\nWith that being said, here is what I use on a daily basis.\nKeeping up with the Joneses Micro.blog I said goodbye to social media a while ago. While I was quite active on Twitter and even more so on App.net and Slack, I have since dropped all of these. There really isn\u0026rsquo;t much point in spinning my wheels there.\nThese days, I post to my own blog, which is syndicated to the Micro.blog timeline and also cross-posted to Mastodon. I\u0026rsquo;m not active on Mastodon, but thanks to the Fediverse, any replies I receive on Mastodon should appear on my Micro.blog timeline.\nPosting to my blog is done via the Micro.blog app or website, which is very frictionless for the most part.\nMy Micro.blog Account My website My Fediverse ID: @alex@alexanderkucera.com Fiery Feeds and FeedBin For my daily news, I tend to watch the local news show Tagesthemen while eating breakfast. This keeps me up to date on both local and global news and politics.\nFor my tech news and other updates, I use Feedbin to curate my feeds and Fiery Feeds for reading them. Fiery Feeds has a few nice intelligent curation options, like Hot Links or Long and Short articles, that make it easy to catch up on too many RSS feeds every day. Yes, maybe I should subscribe to fewer feeds, but with Fiery Feeds, I really don’t have to.\nOvercast Every couple of years, I switch podcast apps. I used to be an avid user of Pocket Casts, and Castro was my favorite player for years. These days, I am back with Overcast. I don’t have any special feelings for it; it works well.\nYouTube Sadly, I am a sucker for YouTube videos. I do not browse the auto-suggestions much, but I have way too many subscriptions. At the moment, my „Watch Later“ queue contains 24 items, most of which are in the 20-30 minute range. However, there are a few videos that are 1.5-3 hours long that I haven’t gotten around to watching.\nDiscord While I don’t engage much on Discord, I follow a few servers to get news announcements and participate in one or two in-person chats. The days when I was active daily for several hours on Slack and Discord are long gone.\nHealth related MacroFactor I recently started using MacroFactor to track my food and water intake. I have been on and off the food-tracking wagon in the past; usually, I track for a week or two before stopping again. The apps I have used in the past, like Lifesum and MyFitnessPal, are all nice and work reasonably well with tracking EU foods. However, they all miss a crucial element: they don’t adapt to one’s personal habits; they simply track food.\nMacroFactor, on the other hand, adapts to your eating habits, providing you with tailored goals and occasionally coaching you on what you can improve or change. It simply clicks with me much more than all the other apps I have tried.\nRP Hypertrophy About a year ago, I finally accepted that I needed to build some strength to get my life back. Due to severe health-related issues, I pretty much stopped moving around 2016. I didn’t blow up, but I lost nearly all my muscle. Moving around the house became a chore at times. Combined with some serious joint inflammation, this kept me sedentary.\nNo more. I started slowly to build muscle again. At first, I went too quickly, which resulted in weeks of not being able to work out due to inflamed joints. However, in combination with MacroFactor, I have been able to manage my food intake in a way that reduces inflammation while providing enough protein and energy to rebuild my strength.\nThe RP Hypertrophy app has been my steadfast companion. There are other exercise apps out there—some cheaper, some more expensive, and some even free—but none of them resonate with me like the RP Hypertrophy app does. The way it allows me to quickly set up a training plan is unparalleled. It also helps me with my progression by analyzing my workout volume. Great! One less thing to think about.\nRP Strength also has a Diet Coach app, but for me, MacroFactor works better.\nWriting Paper I recently stumbled across Paper as a writing tool, and I really, really like it. I haven’t quite found the justification to pay for it yet. It comes with a hefty price tag in my region (the developer consciously charges more in richer regions of the world). However, I might consider it in the future, depending on whether I start writing professionally again in the coming months. For now, I’m going the cheapskate route and clicking away the nag screens that pop up now and again. Sorry, Mihhail!\nTextastic I don’t use Textastic for actual writing, but it is a great general text editor if I need to edit something from my iCloud, modify a file on my server, or whip up a quick Python script or other scripts.\nAirMail My email client of choice is AirMail. There’s not much to say about it, really. It works for me.\nApps by Readdle I use several apps from the Ukrainian developer Readdle. They tend to deliver a polished experience, and their support is excellent.\nCalendars Their calendar solution is top-notch. It supports natural language event creation, the UI is nice, and it works better for me than the native Calendar app on iOS.\nScanner Their document scanner works in a very no-nonsense way. It offers great support for de-skewing and straightening out your wonky document photos. It provides automatic OCR and document naming, and you can create workflows—something I haven’t taken advantage of yet, as my needs aren’t that complex.\nPDF Expert Their PDF reader works great. You can edit and annotate PDFs. Sadly, there is no OCR on iOS or iPadOS yet, but I am told it’s coming.\nStrongbox I used to be a strong 1Password supporter. I bought it way back when I got my first iPhone—an iPhone 4. Since then, I have bought several updates, and when they switched to a subscription model, I purchased the family plan for—I think—two years.\nThen I read a thread on Micro.blog where someone talked about Strongbox. I checked it out, installed it, and took advantage of their very generous three-month trial. After a week or so of use, they had won me over, and I happily paid for their lifetime license after the trial period was over.\nGranted, using Strongbox is a little bit more complicated and less streamlined than using 1Password, but their lifetime license costs what I used to pay for 1Password in a year. There is simply no comparison when it comes to value per euro.\nAI Perplexity I use Perplexity for searching most of the time instead of doing a Google or DuckDuckGo search. I enjoy getting nicely written summarized results, and if I want to dig deeper, I can simply open the sources Perplexity found for a given topic. I haven’t found any instances where the AI hallucinated an answer, but there have been a few occasions where the suggested follow-up questions were just nonsense.\nTypingMind TypingMind is a great ChatGPT interface that allows me to use most ChatGPT features without shelling out over $20 a month. It connects via the ChatGPT API, which results in much more reasonable costs. I got myself a premium license and haven’t looked back since.\nMidJourney Generative Imaging. Some people loathe it; I personally love it. MidJourney is great for quickly generating dozens of variations on an idea, especially since they enabled generation via the website instead of in a Discord chat. We have used it to rapidly create initial drafts and, yes, even final designs for projects, both professional and private.\nGraphics Affinity Designer 2 Since I have mostly stepped back from work, we primarily focus on occasional graphic design for local projects, such as flyers, postcards, roll-up flags, and the like.\nAffinity Designer is unbeatable in terms of price and the value it offers for this purpose. Additionally, we can use it on the iPad for initial mockups and then continue working on the same file on the Mac. Brilliant!\nAffinity Photo 2 It’s pixel-related brother, Affinity Photo, while not as intuitive and powerful as Photoshop, is still nevertheless our main go-to when it comes to editing images. Plus, it works well together with Designer and also offers the same iPad-to-Mac and back workflow.\nQR Factory Since we switched to a more graphic design-based workflow, we regularly need to create QR codes. While there are many online and free generators available, QR Factory offers a comprehensive suite of QR options in one package. I wouldn’t consider using any other option anymore.\nNuke Foundry’s Nuke is my main workhorse for paid work. Although I don’t do as much as I once did, I am still very happy to pay for an Indie license when the occasional project comes in. Nuke remains the gold standard for compositing.\nModo Similarly, when I need to do some 3D work, I use my trusty copy of Foundry’s modo. It still gets me everywhere I need to go—though these days, that isn’t very far.\nOutbank For banking in Germany, this is the way to go. Outbank has the best banking support of any app I’ve tried in the past. The developers had some negative press a couple of years ago related to pricing, subscriptions, and a completely revamped UI design, but I think they have recovered well from that.\nFor my money, this is the best way to keep track of your money, at least for European/German users.\nEtsy and Printful I recently discovered Printful, and it got me interested enough to open our own little Etsy store with designs from the cutting room floor. I mean, why let perfectly good doodles and scribbles go to waste?“\nIT FE File Explorer FE File Explorer is my go-to app when the Files app on iOS won’t suffice. It is also a great FTP client and integrates nicely with our online workflow.\nShellFish ShellFish is my preferred SSH client. I have tried a few others in the past, but ShellFish has really stuck with me. It also integrates nicely with Files.app.\n",

The cleaning still took over an hour. Not only that, but there was a 50% price increase since last time.\n50%!\nI wish I could increase my rates by 50%. That is ten times the current inflation rate. Ridiculous. I think I’ll take my chances and spread apart the cleanings to every other year again, because I do not see the value in getting this done every six months.\n",

However, since it does not publish to Micro.blog that is of no help there as I still need to upload first and then include the link to the media file.\nThis is an online image test: And Bear seems to suffer from the same thing that plagues Bear. It does not export paragraphs properly. Or at least it treats paragraphs in the app differently then on export. A Markdown paragraph is denoted by a blank line between bodies of text. Both Paper and Bear show a simple line-break as new paragraph, but on export the paragraphs get lost due to no extra line break being added. Not terribly hard to work around, but worth noting.\nBut then again, Bear is about a third of the yearly cost. Which makes the choice actually harder and not easier.\n",

Or maybe I simply didn’t get it.\nThe idea of an endless scrolling timeline stresses me out. No unread count. You mean there is no indication of it ever ending? That sounds stress inducing to no end.\nWith my RSS reader (the now called Reeder Classic), I have a ton of feeds that are very high frequency that I only scan to see if something pops out. I have a folder called favorites that I scan more closely. At the end I mark both the „firehose“ and the favorites as read. The posts disappear and I am at ease that I got the most important bits.\nThen I open YouTube take a quick glance at what the homepage suggests. Usually junk. If there is something interesting it goes into my watch later queue. Then I scan my subscriptions. Same deal. Done.\nI do this once a days in the morning. Once.\nDuring the day I catch up on my Micro.blog feed, which is easy, becausee I only follow a couple of people compared to several hundreds I followed on Twitter.\nI don’t need much morere then this. My past self probably would be all over Tapestry and the new Reeder. In fact, I did use a timeline aggregation app about ten years ago from Realmac Software that is no longer available and whose name I have forgotten. They were way ahead of their time back then. Maybe they should dust it off as well.\n",

It always reminds me of home.\nServes 4\nTakes at least 3 hours, better more\nIngredients: 1 kg beef 800g onions 4 cloves garlic 1 teaspoon caraway 1 tablespoon marjoram 4 tablespoon paprika powder 1 tablespoon (white wine) vinegar Salt Pepper 1 teaspoon tomato paste lard or sunflower seed oil broth Directions Dice the onions into rough cubes. Dice the beef into 2-4 cm cubes Heat the lard/oil and fry the onions slowly to a dark brown. Don’t burn them! Purée the onions with a mixer or immersion blender Add the cut up garlic, caraway, marjoram, paprika, and vinegar and mix well add a bit of water and let it simmer for 1,5h to let the flavours develop After the 1,5h is up, add the meat and fill with water or broth. The amount is a bit to taste. The meat should still be visible and not swim in water. Add too much and the sauce gets too thin, add too little and you can always thin it later. Simmer for 3 hours or more on low heat. The longer, the better. In the end, you should have a nice deep red colour and a layer of fat swimming on the top. Stir everything to mix in the fat. Season with salt and pepper. Best prepared the day before. Or even two days before. It gets better with every re-heating.\nEat with baguette, pasta or spätzle. Some heathens eat it with rice.\n🥘\n",

You could publish essays, post photos, start weblogs. … Today, most writing instead goes into a small number of popular social networking sites. … I believe that even these short-form posts, no matter if they seem unimportant and fleeting at the time, still have an important place in the open web. That’s why I created Micro.blog. It focuses on short, recent posts, so I built that idea right into the name.\nAnd since I very much am in favor of owning your content my short posts (or snippets) live on my site now. They get syndicated to Twitter and Facebook, but the original content lives right here on my site. There is a separate RSS feed for it so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t pollute the main blog feed.\n",

I am going to work in Nuke, because it is very well suited for this “under the hood” way of working as it exposes a lot of technical info in its UI already. However, the concepts work the same in any other compositing package like Fusion, After Effects, Photoshop, Blender or Natron. Please refer to your manual for equivalent functions.

				"title": "My current posting workflow while on the go",
				"content_text": "Nick Parfene over in the Indie Microblogging Slack asked me to write about my posting workflow and since I haven’t written about how I blog for over three years it could do with an update.\nWhy change? First, why change the previous workflow? I got confused. Simple as that. My blogging schedule is erratic at best. And the old run and gun style workflow, while working, always left me scratching my head when I hadn’t touched it for a few months. I know, months is a sad amount of idle time between posts. But it is what it is.\nSo to keep myself in the loop what happened to my blog I decided to adopt Git for keeping a publishing history. Not only does it allow me to tinker with the blog’s templates and CSS without messing up, it also serves as a nice automatic history what I did when and for what reason. I just need to read the commit log to job my memory.\nThe in-between workflow The last workflow I wrote about three years ago relied on a desktop machine running. While I have a server machine running 24/7 I did experience too many hiccups with that approach to feel reliable. So I switched it to a two pronged process that worked pretty well. On the go I was posting with Workflow and Transmit and on the desktop I was using Hazel with a custom Python script.\nThis tended to work pretty well. Especially the on the go version. Write stuff in whatever text editor suits you best (I use Ulysses), send over to Workflow for processing and upload to blog with Transmit. For images the procedure is similar only I use ImageOptim or Kraken for image optimization before uploading. I use both at the moment and have not decided which one I like better.\nMicro.blog and Git Now, beginning of this year Manton Reece created a Kickstarter project about Microblogging (Kickstarter is over, but you can enter your details on a mailing list if you are interested in it). I found the idea enticing and so I joined the project. This basically got me fired up to tinker with my blog again, which led to the adoption of Git since I couldn’t make heads or tails of whatever my latest changes to it had been.\nThe idea is really quite simple. Git has the ability to run scripts, so called Hooks, when certain events happen. In my case I use the post-receive hook to check out the newest version of my site whenever I push something to my server’s repository. There are a number of guides available, but the one I found most helpful was Nicolas Gallagher’s.\nOnce that is set up the writing pipeline is really pretty similar to what I had above.\nWrite stuff in whatever text editor suits you best (I still use Ulysses), send over to Workflow for processing, which then sends the article to Working Copy, an iOS Git client. In Working Copy I can check and if necessary correct the post or snippet and then commit and push the changes to my Git repository on the server. There is gets immediately checked out to the live site. For images I still use ImageOptim or Kraken.\nThe desktop version is almost the same really. I also use Ulysses for my desktop writing. From there I go via a custom Alfred workflow that preps the article and then I push the changes up to my Git repository with Tower, but I could just as easily fire off a simple git push from Terminal.\n",

For decades we\u0026rsquo;ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \u0026ldquo;Fck positivity,\u0026rdquo; Mark Manson says. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, shit is fcked, and we have to live with it.\u0026rdquo; In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn\u0026rsquo;t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is - a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck is his antidote to the coddling, let\u0026rsquo;s-all-feel-good mind-set that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed by both academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited - \u0026ldquo;not everybody can be extraordinary; there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault\u0026rdquo;. Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a fck about, so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.\nLink: www.amazon.de/dp/B01KMJ\u0026hellip;)\nVia: The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life\n",

I would walk up to them with a pen and a sheet of paper asking that they immediately draw me a men’s bicycle, by heart. Soon I found out that when confronted with this odd request most people have a very hard time remembering exactly how a bike is made. Some did get close, some actually nailed it perfectly, but most ended up drawing something that was pretty far off from a regular men’s bicycle. Little I knew this is actually a test that psychologists use to demonstrate how our brain sometimes tricks us into thinking we know something even though we don’t. I collected hundreds of drawings, building up a collection that I think is very precious. There is an incredible diversity of new typologies emerging from these crowd-sourced and technically error-driven drawings. A single designer could not invent so many new bike designs in 100 lifetimes and this is why I look at this collection in such awe.\nSuch a great idea.\nThere are some really beautiful designs in there and a few I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind taking for a ride.\nLink: www.gianlucagimini.it/prototype\u0026hellip;\nVia: John Gruber\n",

Most forms of private vice and public evil are kindled and sustained by lies.

He focuses on \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; lies - those lies we tell for the purpose of sparing people discomfort - for these are the lies that most often tempt us.

				"title": "A New Path Trace Approach for \"Finding Dory\" - Christophe Hery - Pixar",
				"content_text": "This post also appeared as part of a longer article on fxguide.\nChristophe took us on a journey through the history of Renderman. From the basics of RSL (Renderman Shading Language) with its empirical shading to RSL 2.0 and the first steps in physically plausible shading to the new RIS path tracing engine that allows physically accurate image creation.\nWe started with RSL 1.2, which basically was state of the art in big budget productions up to 2005. It had the hallmarks of traditional computer graphics: light sources without any size or falloff (in fact, ILM usually didn\u0026rsquo;t use falloff on lights at all even though an option for realistic light falloff existed) and of course idealized materials that had lots of dials for creative control without any regards to physically accuracy or energy conservation. One could easily create a surface that was brighter then any of the lights hitting it for example.\nWith that creative freedom comes a lot of complexity though to get something that can be considered \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; when it comes to realism, a required goalpost when you want to integrate your renderings into filmed footage.\nTo get to an acceptable result quicker and with less complications, Pixar started to implement physically plausible rendering which was first used in Iron Man and later in Monster University to great effect. This proved that both realistic and stylized results were possible with this physically more accurate model despite it having less dials.\nWhile RSL 2.0 was quite successful it still had a few problems. Mainly it slowed down in complex raytracing setups due to Ray Hit Shading taking a lot of time and the memory usage exploded with complex scenes. This lead Pixar to develop a path tracing approach and a new render engine called RIS. For an in depth overview see last year\u0026rsquo;s article on RIS.\nRIS allows for even simpler controls, while rendering more accurately, faster and with less memory then the RSL approach. Shaders are now fully integrated but very modular, which allows for easy debugging or switching out whole block for quickly getting different results.\nFinding Dory, which is currently in production at Pixar, is the first movie that is using RIS. In fact, Dory is the first use of what Christophe calls the RUKUS pipeline: RIS, USD a new interchange format developed at Pixar similar to Alembic and Katana. Christophe joked that he still hasn\u0026rsquo;t figured out what U and S stand for.\nSince RIS has the ability to do progressive rendering, the look development and final rendering has accelerated quite a bit. An artist can set up a complex shot, put it on the farm and then \u0026ldquo;check in\u0026rdquo; after say 20 minutes and get a good idea what the final images are going to look like as the whole image is already visible, albeit very noisy. Then they can just let it \u0026ldquo;cook\u0026rdquo; on the farm until an acceptable noise level is reached. The remaining noise residue is being filtered away as a last step. A technology that Pixar was able to use from Hyperion, Disney\u0026rsquo;s new Path Tracing engine and it will be part of the public Renderman release in the future.\nThis means there is less human (expensive) time needed to set up a shot as there is much less trial and error. Artist always have a really good idea of what the final result is going to look like.\nSadly, Christophe wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to show us final imagery of Dory, as production isn\u0026rsquo;t that far along yet, but we did see a few shots of Dory and Nemo in their new look and they do look much improved from their old selves. We saw them being shaded, lit and look dev\u0026rsquo;ed in realtime in Katana and the experience looked very smooth and seamless.\n",

				"title": "Hyperion - Brent Burley - Walt Disney Animation",
				"content_text": "Brent Burley talked us through the development of Disney\u0026rsquo;s new Path Tracer Hyperion in this session. Path Tracing is the third cornerstone in Disney\u0026rsquo;s new rendering strategy with the former two being PTex and the new \u0026ldquo;principled\u0026rdquo; BRDF (Disney made available a nice tool to explore different measured BRDFs called BRDF Explorer).\nHyperion was used as the main renderer for Big Hero 6, Disney\u0026rsquo;s newest animated feature film. This was a big challenge as the development of Hyperion started only about three or four months before movie production. In essence the development of the movie and the render engine were in sync. This was a bit of a gamble, because the engine didn\u0026rsquo;t have all of its features yet and there was no way of telling how development would turn out down the road.\nLike Manuka, Weta\u0026rsquo;s new render engine, or Arnold, Hyperion is a Path Tracer. The biggest problem with path tracers is the inherent noise. So where you get the benefit of a \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; solution and relatively few dials for the artist to \u0026ldquo;fight\u0026rdquo; with, the downside is that it is very hard to get rid of the noise in a timely manner.\nThis is an inherently mathematical problem to deal with. To half the noise in an image, you have to quadruple the samples fired into the scene. Since you are always halving the noise, there is never a stage where you can reach zero noise. The best you can hope for is to reach a certain noise floor. Meaning all the important details in the image are represented (instead of hidden in too much noise). Once you reach that noise floor, the best solution Disney has found is to filter out the remaining noise.\nTo converge to the noise floor as quickly as possible, there are a few optimization techniques at work. First, rays in areas of common interest are grouped into batches. Those batches receive a high number of samples that are then smartly \u0026ldquo;redistributed\u0026rdquo; to the corresponding pixels. At technique I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet completely grasped, but that I plan to revisit with Mr Burley when I get a chance.\nThe net win seems to be with multiple bounces. First the speed hit is very minimal with multiple bounces and you need less bounces overall to reach acceptable light energy in the scene.\nThis was tested by going into a lighting lab situation. In essence they took a series of photographs and replicated the results with Hyperion. The results where pretty exact and it turns out that images that seemed to deliver wrong results where simply not using enough bounces. Once the proper bounce amount was dialed in, all the glows, light bleeds and so forth started working and the results looked natural.\nAnother optimization technique was the Statistical Lobe Selection Tree, which basically applies weights to the components of a pixel (light influence, reflective, diffuse, refractive influence, etc.). Once you have figured out what influences the pixel most, you can spend more samples there.\nThis got turned on its head when artists started using tens of thousands of lights in a shot. Sorting that many lights would have taken longer then simply brute forcing the sampling. The solution was to figure out where 95% of the influence comes from, which is usually the five or so closest lights, and then use the other 5% for a randomly picked light source.\nThere are also effects that can take a long time to calculate with even just one sample. Like a ray that bounces around skin for a while, just to exit somewhere else with less energy. in those cases Disney used a simple \u0026ldquo;shortcut\u0026rdquo;: biased filtering.\nSay for Subsurface Scattering, Disney simply assumes that a ray exits a random maximum distance from the entry point with a certain amount of less energy. Which works well for most situations for things like SSS or hair. It has issues with small objects, but those can be worked around. The next step in Hyperion development is actually to improve the workflow for those situations in the future.\nAnother common issue were fireflies on water from bright light sources. Sun, anyone? This also is an intrinsically mathematical issue as the sun is a tiny and incredibly bright light source, which means it\u0026rsquo;s practically impossible to converge to a noise free result. The workaround they came up with was pretty genius. They first create a photon map that stores the energy of the refracted and reflected light and then use the calculated light energy values to basically turn hard surface objects into emitters. That means they spread out the high energy light source of the sun and made it trivial to sample. The result were beautiful caustics and inter reflections without any noise or sparkling at a reasonable rendertime.\nA tricky thing with path tracers is the output of different passes for compositing. For this, Hyperion uses a technique called Stochastic Path Classification, which allows inexpensive splitting of a light ray into diffuse and specular components (and a number of additional passes). An added benefit is that it becomes possible to add some artistic local control on top of a shader. They call it transport modifier and it allows artists to tell a surface to use less specular contribution for example.\nOne interesting statistic was that due to the progressive nature of a path tracer only 15% re-renders took place. Meaning that most of the shots only had one final render pass. This was possible because every artist in every department always has a noisy preview of the final image in, more or less, realtime. There were no unexpected surprises, which made it possible to render the whole show in less then four months.\n",

It also was a large enough number that I started to ask myself if I really need this many tutorials or if I am just addicted to collecting as many as possible. I am behind on watching them after all.\nThis got me thinking about the old saying that one should surround oneself with people more skilled then oneself or smarter or generally just better—depending on the source of the quote.\nI work from home, so while I see the wisdom in these words, actually doing something about it tends to be tricky when you are stuck in your own four walls almost 24/7.

I get to see a ton of different people showing me their way of tackling problems and offering solutions I would have never thought of. And, true, open time spots to watch them fluctuate wildly depending on project load, but I am also known for watching tutorials for a whole week straight if business is running a bit slow.\nI feel like this is a very valuable practice that allows me to not only keep my sanity sitting mostly alone in an office, but also fill my subconsious with tons of input that I am able to make use of at a later date.\n",

Occasionally I’ll switch it around, but standing in the morning has the effect of keeping morning drowsiness at bay.\nI can confirm that concentrating while standing is a bit harder at first, but on the flip side I find that I am much more focused once I managed to find my focus.\nI’m lucky as my desk is already height adjustable. Only by about 10 centimeters or so, but in combination with my height adjustable monitor on a little pedestal it is enough to accommodate a sitting and a standing configuration.\nI also built myself a little table for my keyboard, mouse and a glass of water out of a very nice bamboo slab. I’m kind of proud of it. It feels very smooth and doing the little bit of carpentry was refreshing.\nHaving something I built myself also seems to help with daily motivation to actually stand. I had a crude setup before the bamboo table was finished and I noticed that I skipped standing much more often.\nCost for this little endeavor was about €50, but only because I splurged a bit for a nice wooden slab and some high quality varnish.\nAfter a few weeks I feel good about this setup and am already thinking about upgrading it from a standing to a walking desk. The costs for a good treadmill that will fit under a desk are considerable though. From my research I gathered that one will come in at around €1000 no matter which brand. This will need some more pondering, but in the end it is probably worth it to get more active.\n",

Sunstroke is without a doubt the best way to access my Fever feeds on the iPhone and I have tried pretty much every Fever compatible iPhone client out there. It is not as versatile as Mr. Reader on the iPad for sharing out items, but from a pure reading perspective I have yet to find a better app.\n###Twitteriffic\nI hardly use Twitter anymore these days. App.net has almost completely replaced the service with the bird for me. However, a lot of my colleagues still use it and I need a way to occasionally respond to DMs and mentions. Twitteriffic is a beautiful and more then adequate Twitter client for this job.\n###Articles\nFor my Wikipedia research I prefer to use a dedicated client like Articles. This is one area where I grabbed the client that looked best for me way back when I got my first iPhone and I just never tried another one. So there might be better Wikipedia clients out there, but Articles suits me just fine.\n###dict.cc\nWhile my English is reasonably good, I do need to look up words once in a while. I found dict.cc a pretty good dictionary. Plus it is an offline dictionary, which is still something I rely on occasionally in spots with bad reception.\n###WeatherPro\nI usually check the weather by looking out the window—now there\u0026rsquo;s a revolutionary idea! But when I need to look up the weather at a travel destination or to check a forecast for the upcoming week WeatherPro has proven to be the most reliable app for Germany and Europe in general. And it has nice detailed statistical infos and weather radar imagery. Not that I could make heads or tails of those, but they look nice.\n###Outbank\nFor German bank accounts there is nothing better then Outbank. It is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and it actually works with a wide array of banks. While I don\u0026rsquo;t check my accounts daily, Outbank is certainly the cornerstone of my own digital accounting and that of our business.\n###Screens VNC\nAnother one of these \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t use often, but critical when I do\u0026rdquo; apps. Screens allows me to quickly fix things on our server even when I am hundreds of kilometers away from home. Together with Screens Connect, its desktop counterpart, setup is a breeze and I don\u0026rsquo;t have to trouble myself with ports and SSL, etc. It just works.\n###Pushpin\nI use Pinboard for everything bookmarking related, including keeping a downloadable archive of the bookmark, meaning if the page you bookmarked goes offline, you\u0026rsquo;ll still be able to see the archived copy indefinitely.\nAnd a big feature for me is that I use Pinboard as Instapaper replacement. Pushpin is the client that helps me achieve that last part. Right now it is a basic way to browse my bookmarks and catch up on my unread items. However, there is a feature in the works that will make my goal of using Pinboard and Instapaper replacement complete: Offline reading. I don\u0026rsquo;t know when exactly it is coming, but I was assured it is coming and when the day comes it will be glorious. Or so I hope…\n###Dropbox{#dropbox}\nI don\u0026rsquo;t use the app that often, but it is very comforting to know that I have the option. Getting at anything in my Dropbox within a matter of seconds is truly convenient.\n###FaceTime\nSkype can suck it. Especially since Microsoft took over and ruined the app even more. \u0026lsquo;Nuff said.\n##Productivity {#productiviy}\nProductivity is such a loaded word that I try to avoid it. In this case I really am referring to apps that allow me to do work or to keep track of stuff.\n###1Password\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;d be able to survive without 1Password. I\u0026rsquo;d have to use the same password everywhere or juggle paper lists or something. Madness would ensue pretty quickly I am sure.\nThankfully, AgileBits has me covered in the insanity department. 1Password is the first app I install on any machine. And since it syncs via Dropbox I can access my password library even when I am on a random computer with Internet access.\n###Begin\nGreat little to do list app. Simple and very bare bones. Just what I need. I also have Omnifocus, but rarely use it. Begin I actually do use. It is a refreshing take on the old paradigm of creating lists to check off.\n###Mail.app\nWhat can I say? I rely on email and I find the default mail app to be very much sufficient. I have used Sparrow in the past, but with iOS 7 I switched back to the default app and haven\u0026rsquo;t looked back.\n###Drafts\nWhile I prefer to write on my iPad, I do use Drafts on the iPhone to sketch out quick ideas or as simple pasteboard. Sync with the Drafts for iPad app is instantaneous, so I can start a thought on my iPhone and continue it on my iPad in Drafts or Editorial without effort.\nI have set up a nice little array of custom actions in Drafts, which allows me to use it as a plain text journaling app or as a quick entry bucket for story ideas.\n###Calendars 5\nI used Fantastical before Calendars, but as it turns out Calendars has the same natural language event creation, but a much nicer calendar interface. I don\u0026rsquo;t use a calendar that often really, but it is always a pleasure to use Calendars 5 when I have to.\n###PCcalc\nPowerful, quick, to the point. When I need to use a calculator this is the one I turn to. It allows me to be as simple or as complex in my calculations as I need to be and it can do so much more like convert units. Though for unit conversion I tend to use Vert.\nI linked to the free version above as that is already plenty powerful and if you so desire you can upgrade its functionality to suit your needs, which is exactly what I have done.\n###Vert{#vert}\nVert is another one of those laser focused apps without any cruft, a concept that I seem to really gravitate to, don\u0026rsquo;t I? Vert does exactly what it says on the tin. It converts a wide array of units and does so in a fast and efficient manner.\n###CarbonFin Outliner\nSometimes I need a list that is neither a todo list nor a full outline or mindmap. CarbonFin Outliner fills that niche nicely. It is very much alike the famous OmniOutliner condensed down for iPhone. It can be used as todo list app or as full blown outliner with comments and the likes. But it is clean enough that I can use it for my simple list making.\n###Navigon\nThe only turn by turn navigation I use. It is accurate, regularly updated with up to date map data and is generally nice to use.\nFrom the looks of it my global version of Navigon isn\u0026rsquo;t offered any longer on the App Store. Instead there are several region based apps at a cheaper price.\n###DB Navigator\nThe app of the German railway services. More of a nuisance then a must have, but it is better then juggling paper tickets.\n##Media {#media}\n###Castro The new kid on the podcast client block has bedazzled me from the day it came out. Yes, it is very minimal in its feature set. However, I found that it actually offers all the features I need and not more. Before I was using Instacast and lately Downcast, both great apps, but much too fiddly.\nI am so much happier with Castro and without feature bloat. Give it a try. You might like it.\n###Audible\nI cannot say enough good things about Audible. I love the way their service works. I love audiobooks. I love this app. That plus the fact that the support is simply awesome. Recently I found out that you can return two books a year within a year of purchase for a full refund without challenge from the staff. How awesome is that?\nI highly recommend a membership with them.\n###Naturespace\nSometimes I need to switch off my brain completely or shut out the world. Naturespace is brilliant for that. It offers a great collection of high quality nature sounds that really transport you to the recorded location when you close your eyes.\nListening to nature is a poor mans replacement to actually going outside, but it is worlds better then blasting my ears with music all day or using white noise to drown out environmental distractions.\n###Camera+\nMy preferred quick and dirty image editor on the go. It has some nice filters and allows for some quick edits. And it allows me to share my pictures quickly and painlessly.\nThere are other similar image editors like VSCO Cam (which I won\u0026rsquo;t link to, because I despise it), but they all are too slow, ugly or have horrible filters in my opinion.\n###Filterstorm Neue\nNow this is a real work horse. Where Camera+ is my Instagram app, Filterstorm is my image editor on the go. It is pretty amazing what the developer has managed to pull of here. Quick, high quality editing on a tiny screen and excellent sharing options including direct FTP upload.\n###AutoStitch\nI do love panoramas. While the iOS panorama feature looks neat, my iPhone 4 is unable to use it. Also, I usually need more then a single horizontal strip of photos for my panoramas.\nAutoStitch is the best panorama app I have found. I can throw any amount of images at it snapped in all kinds of angles and it stitches them into a coherent panorama at a great quality and at up to 18 megapixels if I so desire.\n###CameraSync\nOnce my images have been taken and edited, I upload them to Dropbox, my main storage location for all my pictures. CameraSync does so automatically in the background with a good selection of powerful options including the ability to prevent screenshots and videos from being uploaded if one so wishes.\n###Unbound\nAfter my images have uploaded with CameraSync I tend to delete them from my device. Unbound allows me to browse my complete image library from Dropbox in a nice interface.\n###Paprika\nA cooking app isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly media, but it is the only category that semi-fit. Paprika is a great recipe app, because it is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and the recipes are synced between the devices. I can type in a new recipe when I am away for work and my wife can cook the dish at home a minute later or vice versa. Perfect.\n##Shopping {#shopping}\n###Amazon\nI get everything from Amazon. The app is at the same time convenient and really not great to use. But it is better then the website at least from the iPhone, so I\u0026rsquo;m using it.\n###Kickstarter\nHi. My name is Alex and I have a Kickstarter addiction.\nSeriously though, I love browsing Kickstarter projects in the app for awesome projects, while at the same time hoping that there won\u0026rsquo;t be, so I don\u0026rsquo;t feel compelled to throw money out the window.\nI really should delete this app…\n###Delivery Status Touch\nThe best way to track where my shipments are at. Fullstop. Again a service that syncs across iOS and OS X. Those are really the most versatile, aren\u0026rsquo;t they?\nSummary Pew, that was quite the list. While I don\u0026rsquo;t use everything on this list daily and these are by far not the only apps I have installed on my iPhone, I would consider this group of apps essential for my daily work and play. I hope there were some nuggets in there for you #teamappdiction people. :)\n",

				"content_text": "Inspired by Federico Viticci\u0026rsquo;s Open Tabs Editorial workflow, I created this little workflow to quickly capture and act on story ideas for blog posts or other text documents.\nIt all starts in Drafts, which I can fire up wherever I go from my iPhone. I enter an idea, or a short title or a link with a comment. This then gets appended to a Markdown file on Dropbox called Story Ideas.md. Conveniently, this file lives in my Editorial folder in Dropbox and show right up on my iPad.\nSo this:\nWrite about this cool workflow Becomes this in my Story Ideas.md:\n2013-12-06 - Write about this cool workflow --- In Editorial, I have a workflow called Manage Story Ideas that allows me to extract an idea from the whole document into a new document ready for editing. Alternatively, I can also delete the idea if I decide it\u0026rsquo;s not worth pursuing after all.\nI wanted the workflow to open up the newly created document ready for editing. Sadly, Editorial currently has a bug that doesn\u0026rsquo;t all that, so that little extra convenience has to wait until the next Editorial update.\nYou can get the Drafts action by clicking here and the Editorial workflow is available on the Workflow Sharing site.\n",

				"title": "The Creative Cringe",
				"content_text": "I\u0026rsquo;m reading Shawn Blanc\u0026rsquo;s wonderful book Delight is in the Details and this one chapter rings especially true with me. It\u0026rsquo;s about what I like to call the creative cringe, the feeling everyone of us gets when we see our work and are not satisfied with it or where we see all the little and not so little flaws that make us cringe.\nShawn is quoting Ira Glass:\n„All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste — the thing that got you into the game — is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it’s normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone[…]“\nI\u0026rsquo;m very much afflicted by this phenomenon. Not that my work is anything special, but I get the cringing feeling almost every time, especially on client projects, where budgets usually are the restricting factor and not the—mythical— perfect end result.\nBut it is important to not let yourself get dragged down and to see this feeling as a sign that there is still some great work hidden inside yourself and that you need to keep working on your skills so you can eventually bring it forth.\nOr as Shawn puts it:\n„If, one day, we feel as if we’ve reached a point where we can create work that will never make us cringe again, then what we’re saying is that what we do today will be just as good as what we do next month, next year, and 10 years from now. And, well, that’s just not fair to our future selves.“\nNow go and do yourself a favor and get reading Shawn\u0026rsquo;s book as long as it is still 25% off.\n",

				"title": "Blogging Workflow…again",
				"content_text": " Yes, I finally am blogging again. Only 6 months of silence this time. Not too shabby.\nAnyway, a major hindrance was that my blogging workflow wasn\u0026rsquo;t working quite right yet, which in turn was like an invisible wall that I was just too tired to climb each time I want to post something. Luckily, I have had the last two days to tinker with it and to figure it out. Now I have a pretty solid workflow. Well, at the moment it looks solid. It is not battle tested however. That\u0026rsquo;s what future blog posts are for.\nBut since it is a little involved, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write it down here right away. For one so I won\u0026rsquo;t forget and also some friends asked me how I am handling blogging from iOS to my Kirby blog.\nTl;dr1 Write your post in whatever text editor you prefer. Ideally one that supports x-callbacks. I personally use Editorial since it\u0026rsquo;s nice for writing and I also use it for processing everything anyway. Before that I used Drafts together with Editorial.\nFire off the Editorial workflow that transforms your text into a blog post with the correct formatting and uploads it to Dropbox.\nCreate or edit any imagery that goes along with the post and upload the images to the right Dropbox folder. The path of said folder has been copied to the clipboard by the above Editorial workflow.\nHave Hazel put everything into place and let it upload to post to the web server.\nThe long version There are several steps involved to make this work. It sounds complicated, but is actually rather straightforward.\nKirby, of course. Drafts (or any other editor that allows you to send stuff to Editorial via x-callback URLs). Editorial, Pythonista works equally well, but Editorial is simpler to set up, plus you can write in Editorial as well and just skip Drafts entirely, which is what I do most of the time. Filterstorm Neue or alternatively Photoforge 2 if you still have access to it. Dropbox Hazel CrushFTP, optional, but depending on the image editor you use more convenient Kirby First of all, why Kirby? Sounds like an awful lot of work for something that Tumblr offers for free. Tumblr even has an iOS app. Just log in and be done with it.\nFor me it comes down to owning what I create. And that involves hosting what I create. Yes, Kirby is a little more involved and— gasp —costs money, but it is really flexible—I built several sites with it for myself, friends and even customers—, fast and pretty cheap considering.\nPlus it works with text files and Markdown, both things that I value dearly and that make this specific workflow possible without a special \u0026ldquo;Kirby iOS app\u0026rdquo;.\nDrafts (optional) For completeness sake I\u0026rsquo;m including my Drafts workflow as well. However, I have since completely switched over to Editorial for writing as well as post-processing my posts.\nI started writing my posts in Agile Tortoise\u0026rsquo;s Drafts, a fine and frictionless text editor with the added bonus that it supports the x-callback URL scheme and a ton of other ways to share or manipulate the written word.\nWhen I write a blog entry, I put the post\u0026rsquo;s title in the first line and the actual post content right after it. If I want a subtitle, that goes at the very bottom with the tag Subtitle:\nSo a typical post in Drafts would look like this:\nThis is my title And this is my content. It can have any content. Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it. ---- Subtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle. When it comes time to share my post with the world, I have a Dropbox action called Blog Post, that will create a file in a designated Dropbox folder—I have a global Apps folder and I put it in a subfolder there—with the name of my post title as filename. It will also fill in a couple of things for me. Most notably the date and the title. So the above post transforms into:\n\u0026lsquo;This is my title.md\u0026rsquo; with the following content:\nTitle: This is my title ---- Date: 07.11.13 (used for display purposes) ---- Time: 2013-11-07-17-33-55 (used for sorting purposes) ---- And this is my content. It can have any content. Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it. ---- Subtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle. You can import this action into Drafts by clicking this link: → Import Blog Posts action into Drafts\nEditorial This first part is part of the old Drafts workflow. Jump to the second part to see how I\u0026rsquo;m working right now.\nThe old way The next two steps are only for the times I want or need images in my posts or if I want to create one of those snazzy banners that are sorely underrepresented in my blog.\nI use Editorial as a simple text filter in this case. I could write something like this for Pythonista to make it work on iPhone (Editorial is iPad only), but I, well, I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it.\nEditorial simply gives me back the future path of my new blog post, something I need if I want to drop pictures into that folder without hunting for the correct folder in my next step.\nI send over my post from Drafts to Editorial with a simple x-callback URL.\nYou can import the URL Action into Drafts by clicking this link: → Import URL action \u0026ldquo;Copy Blog Path\u0026rdquo; into Drafts\nEditorial then cleans it up in a variety of ways. For example, everything gets turned to lowercase, spaces are removed, etc.\nThe resulting URL is copied to the clipboard. In the example above This is my title turns into http://alexanderkucera.com/20131108-this_is_my_title.\nI opted not to run any action after this, as I want to be able to switch to any app I want as the situation requires. But usually it is now on to Filterstorm.\nIf you want to import the URL cleanup workflow into Editorial or simply read through it in detail, you can take a look at this \u0026ldquo;create blog URL\u0026rdquo; Editorial Action\nThe new way Since I have completely switched over from Drafts to Editorial, I had to create a workflow that would prep a standard Markdown document and turn it into a blog post. Since Editorial is much more powerful then Drafts, I was also able to make it a bit smarter, ask for input on a few things and optionally archive or delete a post once I\u0026rsquo;m done with it.\nIt does a lot of things similar to my Drafts workflow though. After all is said and done, a file with the correct naming scheme gets written to a Dropbox folder. And I also get the blog URL at the end from the workflow above.\nThe bonus with the Editorial workflow is that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to watch out for any specific formatting. I can have a standard Markdown document and everything just works™. And Editorial is just really pleasant to work in.\nEditorial Blog Posting Workflow\nFilterstorm (Neue) Filterstorm Neue, is brand new, but the old Filterstorm or Filterstorm Pro have pretty much the same abilities. Or you could use Photoforge 2 if you still have it. The important bit is that the app allows you to either export to Dropbox or to upload via FTP and to give your images a name of your choosing.\nWell, this step is really simple. Do your image edits. Done? Ok. Then upload it to the folder we just had the path created for in Editorial. Simple, right?\nWell, yes and no. There is one step that I consider crucial. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to upload to my web server. I want to upload my image to Dropbox. I consider the Dropbox version of my site to be the canonical copy. Everything goes there first and then gets uploaded to the server. Otherwise I end up with a file mess. Files might get updated or changed here or there. Who knows? By always going Dropbox first, that issue gets sidestepped completely.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have an always on server machine, your best bet is to find a way to upload to Dropbox directly. Photoforge has a Dropbox uploading feature. Filterstorm does as well, though it involves browsing to your posts folder manually instead of just giving it a path.\nFor various reasons, mostly because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hunt down a folder and I have the exact path I need from my Editorial workflow above, I decided to go a completely different route: FTP.\nI happen to use CrushFTP for work anyway, which means I just need to set up an FTP account that points to the blog\u0026rsquo;s content folder in my server\u0026rsquo;s Dropbox folder and the rest is very straightforward. Get path from Editorial and upload to said path.\nHazel The last and final step. The one step that unifies desktop and iOS blogging. Automatically uploading my posts from Dropbox to the server. Hazel is the perfect match for that. Especially since it got the ability to open an FTP connection on its own a couple of versions back.\nThe Hazel flow goes like this:\nLook into the Drafts Or Editorial app folder and check if there is new post. Put the file into a subfolder called \u0026lt;date\u0026gt;-postname. Rename the file to article.md (the name of my Kirby layout template for a blog post) move the new folder with the post in it into my blog There another Hazel rule takes over as Hazel rules only ever can work on one folder at a time. It goes like this:\nIs there a folder? Look into it. Any file that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a red or grey color tag and that has been modified within the day gets uploaded After the upload color the file grey The color tags are there to stop Hazel from constantly uploading files that have been modified inside the \u0026ldquo;today\u0026rdquo; timeframe. But they also allow me to simply take off the color label if I want a file to be re-uploaded.\nGrab the Hazel ruleset here: hazelrules.zip\nThe one called Drafts-Editorial-Folder is for the incoming Drafts or Editorial file and the one called Kirby-Blog-Folder monitors the Kirby blog folder.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it. See? Simple, right?\nSubtitle: Kirby, iOS, Drafts, Editorial, Filterstorm and Hazel tied into a neat bundle\nToo long; Didn\u0026rsquo;t read\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n",

				"title": "Assembling a VFX Camera Kit",
				"content_text": " I don\u0026rsquo;t have my own camera kit specifically for VFX yet. Usually when I am on set, I either rent or get equipment from the production that is hiring me. Now I am about to build my own camera kit and to stay halfway reasonable I want to stay around €6000, though I can go over that amount to get a better kit if need be. And it looks like I might have to.\nI thought I\u0026rsquo;d ask you guys for opinions on what to get and if I maybe can switch around a few things to get the most bang for my buck. Also, writing it all down is more for my benefit really, as it allows me to think through things better.\nThe goal is to build a kit that works well in four different situations:\nProfessional: Set photography (making reference photos, shooting textures, making set HDRis, etc.) Panorama photography (HDRi and normal panoramas) Personal: Since I am a rather new dad (boy, 10 months) I will use the camera for child photography. He is already a speedy little guy and I only see this getting more intense as time moves on. Also, we own three ferrets who are even speedier. So all things considered, I am looking to build a kit that serves well for kid and animal photography as well as on set photography.\nThe List So far my list looks like this (all prices are not yet researched for cheapness but mostly straight off of Amazon):\nCameras: Canon 7D ~€1200 Canon 5D Mark III ~€2600 Canon 5D Mark II ~€2300 I am itching for the full frame sensor. Getting the older MK2 doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to make much sense as it was still rather expensive when I looked.\nThe 7D I am unsure about. Yes, it is cheaper, but also not a full frame sensor. However, I could use the saved money to get more/better glass.\nAnother added benefit of the less then full frame sensor is that is allows me to capture a higher resolution panorama with the 8mm Sigma at the cost of needing one or two more shots to get a full 360° panorama. So higher res, but slower workflow.\nLenses: The options are:\nSigma 8mm Fisheye ~€750 Canon 50mm F1.2 (~€1400) or F1.4 (~€300) Canon 70-200mm f2,8 ~€1000 (without image stabilization) or -2000 (with image stabilization) Canon 70-200mm ~€1000 (or I go f4 with image stabilization) Canon 20mm f2.8 ~€450 Canon EF 16-35mm 1:2,8L II USM ~€1300 Sigma 35 mm f/1,4 DG HSM ~€800 Canon EF 35mm 1:1,4 L USM ~€1300 Canon 24-70mm f2.8 ~€2000 Canon Extender EF 2x III ~€480 I am only sure about the 8mm Sigma and pretty sure I want to get a 70-200mm, but inbetween I am torn. Get a 50mm prime or a 24-70mm zoom? Maybe a 35mm? 85mm?\nI do like the added quality and speed of a prime lens. For my main use case, which will be professional panorama photography, I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to go 8mm (standard, quick on-set pano HDR), 20mm (high-res on-set HDR pano) and 50mm (for those gigapanos and child photography).\nThe 70-200mm will be used for capturing textures and general on-set photography. Still not sure if I want the added quality of the f2.8 or if the f4 with image stabilization is good enough. It is a 1000 bucks difference after all.\nMounts and Tripods: Nodal Ninja with RD16 €449 Manfrotto 055CXPRO4 or 190CXPRO4 ~€200 (not sure, both cost about the same. I am open for other less pricey brands as well) I already have a ball head This setup is pretty fixed. I like the Nodal Ninja and I have a ball head. I am open for a less expensive tripod, but given the quality of Manfrotto, €200 isn\u0026rsquo;t too bad, really.\nRemotes: Promote ~€380 Canon tc-80n3 ~€140 I\u0026rsquo;m unsure about the MK3\u0026rsquo;s bracketing as it only offers 1EV steps at maximum. The Promote would allow me to control that better, but it is double of the \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; (and already rather pricey) Canon remote.\nAll the other stuff one needs and that sucks money away: Sandisk Compact Flash Extreme 32GB 60MB/s (I really don\u0026rsquo;t see the point of going faster then 60 MB/s I\u0026rsquo;m not planning to do much video with it) ~€75 a pop about three or four of these Pelican card case ~€40 DELOCK Card Reader-FireWire ~€50 Hama Lenspen ~€12 Peli 1510 Carry On Case ~€300 or a nice huge backpack that can fit all of this gear. I\u0026rsquo;m open for suggestions here. a ruler of known length for matchmoving purposes greyball 18% grey Spyder Cube (was thinking of taking this instead of the grey ball as it is easier to get then 18% grey paint p lus it is very portable) ~€50 LightCraft Variable ND Fader ND MKII ~€100 B+W Cirkular Polarizer Käsemann F-Pro MRC DH 77mm ~€120 Leatherman Wave ~€70 X-Rite MSCCPP Passport ColorChecker ~€70 Leica D2 Laser measure ~€110 Bosch auto levelling laser cross ~€50 Canon battery packs LP-E6 ~€50 Suunto Pm-5 Clinometer ~€150 various self printed lens charts and tracking markers tapes a whole bunch of them Software Aperture (which I already have) ptGUI (which I also already have) Quite the list, eh?\nI think the stuff at the bottom is pretty much locked in (and already a hefty 1300 bucks price tag), but I am pretty uncertain how to balance the stuff at the top, especially lenses.\nAny ideas?\n",

				"content_text": " I got access to my copy of Shadowrun Returns right on release, July 25th, and immediately ended up playing it of about five hours. Probably your first clue that I liked it.\nIt has been described as Neverwinter Nights meets XCOM by its creators and that description is pretty accurate. I\u0026rsquo;d add that it at times also has a little point and click adventure feel to it.\nOn A Budget Harebrained Software got $1.8 Million from Kickstarter, which, when you take away all the Kickstarter and Amazon fees plus physical rewards, ends up as about $1.2 Million for the actual game. It later racked up the budget with a loan and additional Pre-sales done via their website, so I\u0026rsquo;m assuming that the actual budget ended up in the $2 Million range again. Which sounds like a lot, but it really isn\u0026rsquo;t if you do the math.\nAnyway, the developers did a remarkable job of translating the Shadowrun experience into a playable and infinitely expandable game. The environments are gorgeous, the first story that came with it is pretty solid and supposed to be about 12 hours of gameplay.\nYou can really only tell that they needed to cut stuff by the lack of detail in the characters. They just feel a little unpolished at times. The 3D characters that is. The character art is top notch.\nAnother thing that\u0026rsquo;s sorely missing to give the game that extra bit of atmosphere is a voice over track. It\u0026rsquo;s just a little lackluster to read all the dialogue. But I guess with the idea of an editor that allows you to expand the game ad infinitum, a VO track seems a little unrealistic.\nBut in the end, Shadowrun Returns remains a great, atmospheric game and anyone even mildly into the Shadowrun universe owes himself to check it out.\nSubtitle: Game Review\n",

				"title": "FMX 2013 - OpenSubdiv",
				"content_text": "We startend the session with a quick history of subdivision surfaces. Invented by Pixar and first used in the short Gerry\u0026rsquo;s Game they made away with the constraints of both polygonal modeling as well as Nurbs modeling.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s wrong with Nurbs? Nurbs surfaces are based on control vertices or hull points through which a b-spline is calculated. This leads to smooth curvature and inherent UVs. Both are good. However, Nurbs modeling relies on adding a multitude of Nurbs patches together to form you final surface. He problem arises at those patch seems where it can, and often is, mathematically impossible to create a seamless surface, much less when the \u0026ldquo;patchwork\u0026rdquo; is animated.\nSo Polygons then? Short answer: nope.\nLong answer: While polygons have no problem with arbitrarily complex surfaces or seem cracks, they have their own set of problems. First, they don\u0026rsquo;t have inherent UVs and unwrapping a complex mesh for texturing is no small feat. Second, to get smooth surfaces you need a very high amount of polygons or play cheap tricks with normals, which tend to quickly fall apart under scrutiny.\nSubdivs First, the world in general and Pixar in specific only calls then Subdivs. Not subdivision surfaces.\nAlso, they are the answer to all the problems above. Arbitrarily complex, while always maintaining a definably smooth, crack free surface. Also, with the addition of PTex there is no need for UV unwrapping anymore.\nIn addition, Subdivs support localized levels of subdivision. What that means is that the whole pipeline can work with the coarse base mesh. The modeler can then go into specific sections that need more definition, locally subdivide that area and make modeling changes there. Those will be saved and applied at render time. Bill showed an example of that at work. In Brave, which was originally supposed to play in winter, they had Merida\u0026rsquo;s horse run through a snowy plane. The plane itself had a resolution of about a vertex per square meter. Enough resolution to model snow drifts. However, for the horse\u0026rsquo;s path they locally increased the planes resolution to one square centimeter at render time to capture the fine detail of hooves disturbing the snowy surface.\nAt rendertime The term \u0026ldquo;at rendertime\u0026rdquo; is misleading, because Pixar is now using a GPU implementation of the subdiv algorithm. The implications of that are far reaching.\nAt the simplest level \u0026ldquo;at rendertime\u0026rdquo; in the paragraph before means, the animator gets a live preview of those several hundred thousand faces in real time in the viewport (Maya\u0026rsquo;s Viewport 2.0 in this case, which has OpenSubdiv support built in already). Let me restate that, we saw a demo of a \u0026ldquo;low poly\u0026rdquo; mesh with about 3000 faces animated with bones that had the OpenSubdiv algorithm applied. What we saw on screen were about 3.8 million faces animated in real time. And since Subdivs have the added benefit of getting displacement at hardly any additional cost, those 4 million polygons were displaced as well. Very intriguing stuff.\nThis is not only interesting for VFX though. Since this realities GPU implementation also means games that adopt this will get much more visually complex. And in fact, while Bill could not mention any names, he went out of his way to let us know that major mobile company that produces very popular devices we all own and with the power to dictate the chip manufacturers what to put into their chips will implement hardware OpenSubdiv support within the year. Or as Bill put it, you will likely have devices with hardware support built in the next time you see me.\nGood for Pixar. How do I get it? That\u0026rsquo;s the nice part. You likely already have the technology available to you. For one OpenSubdiv is open source and all the licensing for the technology is available for free as well. Also, if you use Maya, you have access to all this already. Maya uses the exact same algorithm Pixar uses since Maya 5.0 and now also has the GPU implementation through Viewport 2.0.\nSo no excuses, get cranking!\nSubtitle: Talk by Bill Polson, Director of Industry Strategy, Pixar\n",

				"content_text": "This talk was very theory heavy with lots of formulas and photos of curves that summarize pretty badly. I still gave it a try here.\nThe session started with the history of camera tech. From the first wooden boxes with a hand crank.\nA hand cranked camera had severe restrictions in that it obviously only could film where a human operator could go and there wasn\u0026rsquo;t even adjustable focus. Since then we have come a long way. Huge VistaVision camera rigs, car cranes with two seat at the top end of the crane (Titan crane) and Technocranes, which was the first camera crane that didn\u0026rsquo;t need someone to look through the lens allowing much greater range of camera freedom. This was thanks to Jerry Lewis idea of a video feed.\nAfter that came the motion control rigs, which not only allow repeatable motion to shot many matching passes of a shot, but also allow the combination of live footage with camera matched 3D footage or miniature footage.\nSetting The Scene it\u0026rsquo;s imperative to set up your film back accurately after that setting the focal length should give you the correct field of view you need to set up your nodal point on set correctly live action usually is not nodal, meaning there is a parallax while panning this must be matched in the 3D camera Real Life Camera Motion In 3D Cameras must adhere to physics, which means there is a limit to the acceleration of an object. Not speed. Acceleration. Meaning sharp changes in speed, up or down, directional changes.\nThe acceleration can be derived by the second order derivative of the position change (translation curve). Ideally, you want your 3D curves to accelerate gradually with no more the 9.82 m/s or 1G. Some motion control sYstems can handle more or less.\nOf course, there is also a certain speed limit involved.\nProblems Capturing Live Motion For Repeatability A problem arises when you have a camera motion, usually SteadyCam shots, that you need to transform into a motion control shot. For example, you film your actors with a SteadyCam in a greenscreen setup and then you need to repeat that move with a motion control rig on a different set or a miniature.\nThe way to go about it is to match move (track) the shot, which will give you a rather noisy result, at least in motion control terms, which you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to program. You can smooth the result, which will loose you accuracy, but enables you to program the shot. The trick is to filter enough, without leading to misalignment.\nSubtitle: Talk by Anthony Jacques, VFX Camera Operator\n",

Alembic, OpenColorIO, OpenEXR to name a few.\nBefore every company needed to reinvent the wheel in-house to set itself apart. Now they can work on a common standard which helps with interoperability between companies, which is something that is required in today\u0026rsquo;s industry.\nWe have moved from \u0026ldquo;secret sauce\u0026rdquo; to common baseline, which also includes the game industry.

That should tell you pretty much everything you need to know.[^1]\nCloud Based Solutions Cloud based computing power is something that is a topic everybody was interested in, even the big houses, who usually have several thousand render farm computers of their own. There are immense draws to this kind of workflow. From lower overheads, due to savings on machine, administration and licensing costs to being able to ramp up render power quickly when you need it during a deadline crunch.\nThis interest is something that is shared equally between small studios like ours and the big boys. And only expected to expand in the coming years. Ludwig von Reiche talked a bit about cloud computing applications in development, running on Amazon Elastic Computing among others, which he expects to come out within the next year.\nWhile there are already solutions that offer Amazon Cloud rendering, they are usually cobbled together requiring a small science degree to figure out. We are talking about more accessible solutions.\nRob Bredrow argued that there are really two sides to cloud computing. One is the reduced cost due to less inventory and running costs. The other side is to add a lot of render power on demand, say 1000 or more machines to render a shot in an afternoon. That might cost more, but speeds up the creative cycle and might be worth it from that perspective.\n[1]: That\u0026rsquo;s around where I got bored and lost a bit track of the conversation.\nSubtitle: Panel Discussion with Marc Petit (Autodesk), Rob Bredow (SPI), David Morin (Autodesk), Don Parker (Shotgun), Ludwig von Reiche (NVIDIA ARC), Cevat Yerli (Crytek)\n",

				"content_text": "Starting out with a short overview of RiseFX, his company, Florian dove right into the workflow for Cloud Atlas. RiseFX has garnered a reputation for using innovative approaches to set extensions and they didn\u0026rsquo;t disappoint on Cloud Atlas either.\nStarting out with some stats:\nmost expensive German movie to date at 100 million US dollars financed independently internationally lots of famous actors in multiple wildly different roles shot only in European locations standing in for totally different environments pre–production started July 2011 with the previz of 1973 San Fransisco and the Luisa Rey car crash shooting started in August Car Crash The previz was very accurately planned and is pretty much verbatim like that in the movie.\nFilmed on a bridge in Scotland, which lead to major cleanup work as the bridge was supposed to lead to an island not to mention be in San Francisco. A major challenge was that it plays at night with various camera crane moves showing kilometers of street environment. While you could in theory light that set, there would be huge amounts of lights, power and therefor budget involved.\nSo the guys went ahead, shot her on the backlot of Rise in Berlin in front of a blue-screen. For the bridge, they made a 3D scan of the environment that got them a textured and completely relightable. Easy.\nThe crash itself was filmed on a gimbal with added CG trash elements floating around giving a zero gravity effect.\nThe car crashing into Halle Berry\u0026rsquo;s car was a 3D car for a simple reason. The director liked the movement of the car in a specified shot, which was unfortunately unusable due to plate errors. So the car was modeled and textured based of all the different takes. Then the preferred shots car was match moved and the 3D car placed into the shot.\nPlane Crash The plane crash was a pretty straightforward Houdini simulation. However, for this project RiseFX adapted a 100% Houdini approach, unlike what most other companies do, simulate in Houdini and model, animate and render in another package. This approach saved the, a lot of headaches as everything could interact and be rendered in the same package.\nWhich means for the plane explosion that not only could the simulation influence the fluid simulation, but also they could light the geometry with the fluid simulation. Meaning the explosion light everything physically correctly including all the small debris.\nLots of environment re–projection Having all the sets as Lidar 3D scans meant that they could very easily redress entires sets and just replace them with the 3D model. It also made relighting a lot easier.\n––––\nSubtitle: Talk by Florian Gellinger\n",

				"content_text": "Next week is FMX, a great yearly convention about visual effects, games and virtual reality. I\u0026rsquo;m there every year reporting for Professional Production Magazine and I thought this year I could up my game and write little short blurbs on this blog about the sessions I attend. I asked around and there was some interest from people that could not make it this year or which are interested in the topic.\nSo far so good. There was only one problem. I switched to using Kirby as the back end system of all my websites including this blog. Kirby is a great lightweight system for web publishing. Only, because it is still so young, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a mobile client that allows you to create posts or pages easily. True, it comes with an admin panel, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work offline and it also doesn\u0026rsquo;t work on my iPhone. So I was looking for something that better suited my needs. And I had a first version working.—\nDrafts, Dropbox, Hazel, Rsync. Easy, really. Since I only had a few hours here and there, it is still really rough and not as elegant as I\u0026rsquo;d like, but it works. I am now able to use Drafts to compose my posts on either my iPad or my iPhone, or start on one and finish on the other, since notes are always kept in sync, send the post to Dropbox via Draft\u0026rsquo;s custom Dropbox actions where it is picked up by Hazel, renamed to fit my Kirby naming convention, put into the right folder and then uploaded via Rsync.\nPictures work, too So much for plain text posts. But pictures work, too. Though they are still very much a pain. iOS\u0026rsquo; default camera app records the orientation of the device as EXIF data, so portrait orientation pictures are not actually rotated, but the EXIF Orientation is set to 90° or -90°. Which is all nice and fine, except Safari, and a few other browsers, disregard the EXIF orientation, so images appear in landscape on my site after I upload them. That sucks. The only way around that is to either do anything to the image in Camera+ or another photo editor and save the result, which bakes the rotation into the image. Or to write a function in Hazel that bakes the orientation into the image after I upload it to Dropbox. I\u0026rsquo;m probably going to go with the latter, since I\u0026rsquo;m trying to save battery life and using Camera+ a lot sucks down battery life quite a bit.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. To get my images up to Dropbox I use a great little app called CameraSync, which has Geofencing support, meaning I don\u0026rsquo;t have to do anything to upload the picture to a folder of my choosing on Dropbox. Also, and this is the killer feature, it resizes them before the upload, saving me time and bandwidth.\nThe biggest pain from here is that I still need to manually move the images into my blog posts folder and rename them from somename–timestamp.jpg to the naming I use for images in my blog. I have not found a smarter way to do it yet then to do it manually. As I said, the whole process is still rough around the edges.\n",

They always do.\nI work with my MacBook Pro at home and at the office. That is of course nice, because it is my only base of operations and I have everything in one place.\nBut do you know the feeling that you are working with your laptop at work and don’t want anyone to snoop around on it, because it also is your private laptop and has all kinds of personal stuff on it? I know I do.\nLuckily there is an easy fix for that. Enable the setting that pops up a password request after your machine wakes from sleep or when it disables the screen saver. But now you always have to enter the password at home, too. Kind of annoying.\nThere is an easy fix for that as well. The key is location aware software like [MarcoPolo] 1. MarcoPolo allows you to trigger certain actions depending on where it knows you are at the moment. Pretty cool stuff. That means it allows you to enable or disable the screen saver password at home or at work. Neat isn’t it?\nI made a little [screencast] [2] walking you through the steps. All you need is MarcoPolo which you can get for free from the [developers website] 1.\nIf you don’t want to use MarcoPolo you can also use AppleScript to do the same thing with whatever software you prefer. In fact I used the scripts with MarcoPolo, because I overlooked the very convenient built-in action that already does that.\nThe AppleScripts are as follows:\n####Enable Screen Saver Password\ntell application \u0026quot;System Events\u0026quot; tell security preferences get properties set properties to {require password to wake:true} end tell end tell ####Disable Screen Saver Password\ntell application \u0026quot;System Events\u0026quot; tell security preferences get properties set properties to {require password to wake:false} end tell end tell Have a look at the screencast for more in-depth info.\nscreencast\nI hope you enjoyed this little hint.

We had some nice effects and compositings in there, but the director decided that it is a documentary not an effects movie. A good decision if you ask me, although it is a pity the effects never me it into public.\nWhat is left is a few name removals from signs and some other invisible effects to increase the quality of the material like degraining or resizing and reframing, etc.\nWe are shipping the DVD which has English subtitles (Yay! I finally can understand what I contributed to!!!) over the company website and through the normal DVD stores beginning of June. So just grab a copy and make the success even bigger, will ya?\n",

				"title": "How to Work Efficiently",
				"content_text": "A lot of times I hear people complaining how slow this or that program is. “shake is so slow”, “motion is total crap” or “why is this taking so long?”\nWell, guess what, there is actually a solution to it. And the magic word is workflow. We are working on pretty heavy projects most of the time. HD material (even if the output will be PAL in the end), 2K material for film or lots of layers or 3D layers. All that stuff is by definition slow. Especially if you work in a more complex setup then one or two layers. Add to that, that we are working in a network based environment and you get a workflow slow as molasses.\nThere are a few things you can to do help pretty much every program to work faster.\nDon’t work in full resolution Don’t turn on all the effects, just because it looks better Don’t work over the network THINK before you work Don’t work in full resolution Yes, I know, you just built the most sexy motion graphics ever and you feel like looking at it over and over again, while tears run down your cheeks. Don’t.\nYour first responsibility is to work as fast as you can, because that allows for making it even better and being more flexible when the customer has last minute changes. It is of little importance to look at your masterpiece in 100% resolution and highest quality most of the time. Don’t use these settings until you really need them to judge the final output quality.\u2028For all other cases go ahead and turn down the display size to 50% and the display quality to a third or a proxy of a third. Some applications even offer the option to go one step lower in quality as soon as you move things around. Use that.\nAnother thing you should think about is the use of proxies. A proxy is a lower resolution version of your footage. So instead of working on HD material you work on PAL or half PAL material. After Effects and shake both support the automatic use of proxies. That means they automatically switch from low-res to high-res version as needed. To see how that is done, have a look at the tutorial video, that describes it in more detail.\nDon’t turn on all the effects, just because it looks better Yes, that 3D lighting in AfterEffects is sexy. But if you are working on font sizes, it is absolutely irrelevant. So switch it off. Same goes for every other effect that slows you down, but has no effect on the part you are working on at the moment (Motion Blur, other kinds of blurs, re-timing, heavy 3D, particles, you name it). It is much faster to switch off 5 effects, do a change and switch them on again, then trying to make a change while waiting 5-10 seconds for the screen to update.\nDon’t work over the network You might have a pretty fast network, but when 10-20 people work with HD or 2K footage over the network it slows down. Nothing that can be done about that. Except to copy your source material to a local drive. That will be way faster to work with then waiting for your bits and bytes to trickle through the cable.\nTHINK before you work Seems pretty obvious, right? Try to think before you start working.\nWorking locally is fast. But if it takes 2 hours to copy footage to make a 10 minute change, then it might not be the most efficient way of working.\nGenerating proxies is cool if you work on a shot for several hours or days. But generating proxies takes time as well. It might be faster to just open a file, do a quick change and render it out again.\nAssess the situation and act accordingly. But don’t get lazy!! If you see a benefit, do it!\n",

				"title": "Twitter for Colloquy",
				"content_text": "I don’t know if you already know this service called [Twitter] 1. It can be described as a IM independent status message, so you can notify people of your current doings if you like.\n[Coda Hale] 2 created a [Quicksilver action to post conveniently to Twitter] 3. [Ted Leung] 4 thought it would be nice to have [Growl notifications] 5 in the mix and [Matt Matteson] 6 thought it needed a bit more sparkle by [adding iChat support] 7. Well, now I add two more options to the mix.\nFirst I created a modified version of Mattesons’ script to work with [Colloquy] 8 — my favourite IRC chat client (Which I also use for IQC, MSN, Jabber and IRC via the help of [BitlBee] 9). This worked out pretty straightforward and nice — and can be downloaded here (for setup instructions go to [Coda Hale’s page] 3). But then I thought it is stupid to have to change my status message of my chat client outside my chat client. So I sat down a little while longer and created a Colloquy script that posts to Twitter — including Growl notifications.\nThis script works like the normal /me commands in IRC but also posts the text behind the /me command to Twitter. Users of Colloquy should know what it does, but for you non-IRC people, /me creates an _action_ message so /me is hungry becomes AlexK (my nickname) is hungry. And on [Twitter] 1 it says _AlexK (my username there) is hungry_. It makes perfect sense (to me at least).\n###How to install\nTo install it download this file, unpack it and save it as twitter.scpt into your Colloquy plugins folder (~/Library/Application Support/Colloquy/Plugins/twitter.scpt), then restart Colloquy (on some machines a system restart was necessary for unknown reasons).\nThen you need to configure it. If you’re not already using [Twitterrific] 10, open Keychain Access and add a new password with the following data:\nKeychain Item Name: http://twitter.com Account Name: Your email address Password: Your Twitter password If you’re already using Twitterrific, this password will already be in your Keychain. So just sit tight.\nNow you can use it with the commands /tweet or /twitter like so /tweet is testing out this cool plugin. It should send and action message to your current chatroom (Nickname is testing out this cool plugin) and also to your Twitter account (Username is testing out this cool plugin). After it succeeded you will get a Growl notification.\nOn first use you will be asked if it is ok that the script gets access to your Keychain. This is fine and you should allow that. On first usage it might also take a little bit longer, but from then on it should run pretty fast. At least it does so over here.\n###Caveats\nI have one guy who had problems with it running very slow (up to 15 seconds), but over here is runs pretty much realtime. Of course it has to send data over the internet, so that might be a slowdown factor. I guess if you like just try it out.\nUPDATE: [Jesse Newland] 11 linked the slowness to AppleScript needing a lot of time to access the Keychain in some cases. Maybe a bug on Apple’s side? Anyway he suggest to [use Rubygems to work around this] 12. Thanks for that workaround, but I am not too hot on installing an extra piece of software just for this. But for all of you out there who have problems with my Colloquy/Twitter script being slow this might be a viable solution.\nAnd as always with this home-brewn scripts, I cannot give any guarantee that it works and I also distance myself from any damage done by it. It works great over here, but I cannot guarantee this for your setup. That is all I can say.\n###Following are comments from the old blog\nBlaine Says:\nNice. It’s very cool to see twitter inching its way into every nook and cranny of the desktop and not.\nAny particular reason you didn’t use Bitlbee’s Jabber integration to help you out?\nAlexander Kucera Says:\nWell, two reasons Blaine.\nI hardly use Jabber these days When I use the Jabber route I am locked in to using Jabber Let me explain the second one.\nLet’s say I am in an IRC channel. I’d have to switch the room to a Jabber connection to send my message to the twitter user.\nWith my script I am independent of the room I am in. It just intercepts the command and send it to Twitter. I don’t have to think about sending it to a specific user or anything else. I just type my command and it sends.\nVery easy, very “out of my way”. I like to keep it simple, otherwise I end up not using it.\nRinoa Says:\nFound you on digg. Have you considered having your script submitted on the Colloquy website?\nAlexander Kucera Says:\nHi Riona,\nI wanted it to be tested by a few more people before making it an “official” part of the Colloquy site. But yes, I am definitely thinking about submitting it.\nBlaine Says:\nThat makes sense. I didn’t realize Bitlbee was presented as an independent room in IRC.\nKeep up the good work, and let us know (help@twitter.com) if there’s anything we can do to improve twitter!\n",

				"title": "Naming Conventions - Part 02 - Real Life Application",
				"content_text": "Last time I talked about the basic ingredients of a working naming convention, which got inspired by a topic covered on [Lifehacker] 1 and [43 Folders] 2. What to avoid — like never using the word “final” in any circumstances — and what to include — for example version numbers.\nThis time I will show you how to use this new gained knowledge and plug its elements together into a working template for a professional naming convention. Just read on to find out how it’s done.\n###The Template\nActually it is very simple. Take what we have spoken about last time and plug the elements together to get a working naming convention, like this (this might wrap a bit unlucky, if so just wait till we get to the real life example — which reads more easily — two lines further down):\n\u0026lt;project-name\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;file-content\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;version-number\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;changes to the version before\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;author\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;file-extension\u0026gt;\nEasy, isn’t it? So in a more lifelike example we get:\nambul_keying-Shot012_03_fixedMaskIssue_AlexK.mov\nThis file is part of the project called “The Ambulance” and it contains the greenscreen keying and compositing for shot 012 and is in it’s third revision. The change to the last version is a fix in one of the masks (which probably was wrong in version 02) and the change was done by me.\n###It sorts in groups…\nAs you can see this is a pretty human-readable filename. And just from looking at it we can see what is going on. And because of the way we built the filename it sorts correctly when we sort by filename in the file-browser. We will always see the shots for the project “ambul” together, followed by all versions of keying shots, then the individual shots in order and then the individual versions of a shot.\nAnd if you ever accidentally save your file in the wrong folder(another project or your local drive instead of the projects drive), it becomes pretty easy to find again, because it includes the project name.\n###…and is extensible\nThe nice thing about this order is that we can now add as many additional informations to the filename as we deem necessary after the version number — like in this case the changes to the last version and the authors name. We will always get it sorted in the right way, because the version number comes first in the filename.\nAnd we also need not worry about including the date in the filename directly in most cases, because the operating system takes care of this automatically.\nThere is not one correct way — the template adjusts to your taste\nThere are of course many different options to express the same information as above. We could also write any of the following:\nthe ambulance_keyingShot012_ _version03_fixedMaskIssue_AlexanderKucera.mov amb_gskS012_03_fixMask_AK.mov ambul.keying_Shot-012.03.fixedMask.AlexK.mov ambul-keying shot 012-v03-fixed mask issue-AlexK.mov All these versions contain the same info. Some are more verbose, others less. Some are easier to read, others less. I tend to stick with underscores to divide the individual chunks of information and dashes or a combination of small and capital letters to make the individual chunks more readable. This comes from my programming history. If other schemes are easier to read for you, take them instead. This part is completely up to your taste and doesn’t influence the effectiveness of this naming convention as long as you always use the same method.\n###Do yourself a favor — stick to it\nStick to it once you have a working naming convention. And please don’t try to change it after every project. You will be thankful for sticking with it when that project resurfaces after a month or a year.\nIf you have questions or suggestions about my way of naming files please leave a comment. I’d love to read about your ways of tackling this issue.\n",

How do we go about naming this content so we can easily see what we are dealing with?\nnever ever use the word “final” for any file do not put too much information in the filename put much info in your filename number your files incrementally — always stick to your naming convention ###Never ever use the word “final” for any file\nWell, plain and simple: never use the word “final” as an integral part of the filename. For the simple reason that it never will be the final version. And what do you do then? Name your file “final_final”? Or “more_final”? It just won’t work out, so just don’t do it. Simple isn’t it?\nOh and while we are at it, try not to use these words either:\ntemp test preview ###Do not put too much information in the filename\nI don’t know about you, but when I want to read a story, I read a book. But when I am working I need to know which file is containing what — fast. That means the filename should only contain what is necessary to communicate its content. Nothing more. But most importantly nothing less, which leads us to the next point.\n###Put much information in your filename\nWell, as I wrote above, when you look at a file in your file-browser you need to see instantly — without opening the file — what it contains. For that you need to put all the important info into the filename.\nBut what is important you ask? Well, that certainly depends to a degree on your working environment and projects. A few things stay the same nevertheless. Lets make a small list. We normally need to know:\nwhat project this file belongs to what the file contains who created the file (in a multi-user workspace) which version it is what changed to the version before it when it was created There you have it. Not an awful lot, isn’t it? To see how we squeeze all that info in a short and readable filename read on.\nThere are two ways to tackle this. One is to use shortcuts like the first letters of your project (MIB = Men in Black), the other one is to use plain readable text. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.\nShortcuts make filenames shorter and for the duration of the project probably also more readable (because you can see more of the information in a filename at once). On the other hand it will be probably pretty hard to decipher what a filename was meant to mean after a month or two when you have to revisit a project.\nI tend to use a mix of both to get something as descriptive but short as possible.\n###Number your files incrementally — always\nThis is also an important one. Always number your files starting with 01, not 1, but 01, because you never know, it might end up being the first of many drafts before the final — or, to stay consistent with our rule about not using the word “final” — the version that we end up using. So to avoid ugly constructs like version 2b5-new, we just stick to simple numbers 01, 02, 03 and so on. The recent version wasn’t good? No problem, make a new one and increase the version count. That leaves you with room for up to 99 versions, enough for even the most error and revision prone projects.\n###Stick to your naming convention\nWell, this seems to be obvious, but it isn’t very easy, especially in a working environment that has no rules about files names. Co-workers don’t use it, so why should you? To stay on top of the chaos and to lead by example. Once your co-workers see how easy and efficient a working naming convention can be they hopefully will switch to it, too.\nI hope this was some useful info and if you wan to find out how we transfer this knowledge into a real life naming convention, then come back next week when I show you how I tend to use it.\nAlso please let me know what you think about this topic in the comments. Until then, take your work to the next level.\n",

				"content_text": "We met our new interns today and they all seemed very nice. One of them made a little bad impression though. Not only was he new in the company, but he also made bold statements about his future work. And he had never touched that area before, so what he said was either over the top or just wrong. Both things made him look like an arrogant guy or someone who has no clue at all (I am not sure which one fits better).\nI think he could have avoided that hint of a bad impression with a little reality check before opening his mouth. He was the new guy, so the first thing he said should not have been to disagree with the two residents of our company who do this job for over two years now. At least not about a thing he obviously has no clue about. So before you start braging, check first how things in your future work environment work. And even if you think, you know better then all the guys, who did this job way longer then you, there are smarter ways to show you know something. Don’t make a statement. Formulate a question.\nFor example, instead of “To do job X like that isn’t smart, because that will give you crappy quality”, try to formulate it as a question that doesn’t insult your conversation partner (even if you think you are right). Say something like “I heard, that doing job X like this means loosing quality. Is that right or did you find a way around it?”. It’s a win-win situation.\nIf you are right about it, your (probably more experienced) future co-workers, will be impressed because although you never worked in the area you have done your homework. If you are wrong, you don’t make the impression of someone who didn’t do his homework, because you didn’t make a statement, you asked a question. And because you asked a question, you also have the chance to learn, because what you will now get is an answer.\nOf course this basically is true for every situation where you come into a group of people. You first should find out where you stand before you burn bridges.\nI just had to get this off my chest.\n",

				"content_text": "It seems like a niche market that had to be filled sooner or later. After Apples decision to quit the development — and with it the support and maintenance — of shake with version 4.1, there is a big hole in the support area of shake. Of course, there are the normal forums like [fxshare] 1 (formerly highend2d) or [cgTalk] 2, but for deep down support it is always nice to have the developers at hand, because only they know, what really goes on inside the code.\nWell, I was not the only one who had that thought. Billy Woody, the primary support engineer from Apple, said goodby to Apple and hello to the shake community. He will be supporting shake users from his new base at [shakesupport.com] 3.\nShakesupport.com offers quite a good deal compared to the $1499,- a year one had to pay for Apples shake support. Woody offers a similar support for only a fraction of that, beginning at $100,- a year (for a single license and people who subscribe until 1st November 2006) up to a cheap $1000,- per year for the big houses with 51 and more licenses.\nWoody will probably be quite busy, considering the price drop opened up shake for a whole new audience of users. But these users also will have to struggle with the user interface, which is not exactly made for the casual user. So I see a golden road ahead of Woody and wish him all the best for this project. Shake will probably keep him busy for quite some time, even after the shake successor comes out.\n",

				"content_text": "Yes, you understood it correctly. [Messiah] 1 is able to run on the [new Intel Macs] 2. And I am not talking about [BootCamp] 3 here fellows. I am talking about not having to restart your Mac to run Messiah. Being able to check mail or work in your favourite Mac application and simultaneously running the 3D character animation software Messiah. Don’t believe me? Here is the proof:\nWhat you see on the above image is Messiah running on [an emulated Windows environment called Parallels Workstation] 4. Take a look at the FPS counter in the perspective view of Messiah. It runs realtime and blazingly fast!! I nearly died of excitement yesterday seeing this. Everything looks great and fast and… I am getting goose bumps again.\nIt runs perfect from a performance point of view as far as I can tell. Unfortunately my PC just died and I have no real test scenes available. So if someone has a nice and heavy scene for me to test on the virtualized Messiah - please be my guest. I’d love to test it out further.\nOne downside exists, however. The mouse input seems kind of broken. Whenever I try to change values by dragging (a slider in the properties tabs, the edit sphere, the perspective view) Messiah only adds the numbers in one direction. Meaning, when I increase the x translate and then drag in the other direction to decrease it, the value doesn’t decrease but just increases further. This could be a real show stopper, if it stays unresolved.\nBut I am sure some smart guy out there finds a solution.\nUpdate: Check out my screen capture of Messiah running under OS X.\n###Following are comments from the old blog\ntorncanvas Says:\nHow did you get your hands on an accelerated version of Parallels? Or is it accelerated? What is going on here?\nAlexK Says:\nNo, this version is not accelerated. It is the same 15 day trial you can download for yourself torncanvas. No tricks, no bells and whistles. I didn’t even install any Windows update. This is just a plain Service Pack 1 install. Nothing more -except the parallels graphics driver of course, which allows to use resolutions higher then 800×600.\n",

				"title": "Renderman vs MentalRay - the Uproar",
				"content_text": "Well, guess what? As I already thought it would happen, some people don’t seem to like the conclusions of my test. Zealots are so easy to predict and so hard to please.\n####“You cannot do it like this. Testing the renderers with a simple teapot in the scene is totally unfair!”\nWell, huh? How can a teapot be unfair? It is a simple geometry for crying out loud! If I had used a sphere or a torus (something not obviously produced by Pixar) it wouldn’t have made a difference.\n####“You didn’t use the right MotionBlur Settings, that is unfair!”\nWell, true, MentalRay also has something called Rapid Motion Blur. But that sucks too. I didn’t include it for two reasons. (1) It sucks. Or in a longer version: Every time I tried it, I got major render artifacts, so I just didn’t consider it for this test. (2) It sucks. Longer version: It is still way slower then Renderman for Maya. Well, my bad, I should have included it for sake of comparison.\n####“You didn’t tweak MentalRay right, there is way more to tweak to make it faster!”\nWell, it wasn’t part of this test to find out which renderer I can waste the most time with. In my business it is important to get results fast. Every minute spent at tweaking render times is nearly the same as rendering a slow renderer. Because if I spent two hours at tweaking or loose two hours due to bad render settings doesn’t matter. In the commercial business I have to deliver. Fast.\nIn my tests there was nearly no tweaking involved for Renderman (which I knew nothing about before these tests), but quite a bit to make MentalRay to look even that good (which I have worked with for quite some time now). In my book that means MentalRay is slower (and yes slower means also that it has more knobs to tweak it and loose time in the process).\n####“Sure Renderman is great, but Renderman for Maya is a completely different product. You can’t compare that!”\nWell, yes and no. It is about RfM, but the only difference to PRman is the interface and what you can do with it. The rendering engine is 100% the same. So what goes for one, goes for the other, too. With the addition that PRman is more configurable. Same goes for MentalRay for Maya. It is an interface for the MentalRay renderer. As such you have a small subset of what is possible in a point and click way. I tested this point and click way. Not any nifty shaders and special moves (which you can do with both RfM and MentalRay for Maya by the way).\nAnyway, the results are the same, no matter how you turn it. MentalRay has it’s niche in the raytracing hyper-realism section, where there is no need for motion blur or fast displacements. But as far as good production value goes for day to day projects in a commercial environment (and for movies too as far as the general knowledge goes) Renderman is still superior. It is fast and easy to tweak (especially the RfM plugin) and gives fast and superior results.\nAnyone interested can read the [Renderman vs MentalRay discussion on cgTalk] 1.\n###Following are the comments from the old blog\nvirgil Says:\nman, how can you render in RfM without errors and hours of tweaking? this is one thing I’m strugling with right now, that I keep having all kinds of weird issues, errors, and such, and I manage to debug it in the end, but at the cost of losing many-a-neuron one other question, as I actually started a quest of trying to figure out the mistery behind the allmighty render-passes in RfM. how do you… do it? that tab in the render settings is alien technology for me right now, any tutorials, advices, anything? I’d surely most apreciate that. thanks in advance.\nAlexK Says:\nI actually don’t know. I just use it. Works fine.\nConcerning the Render Passes…well…same thing here. I just use em. Maybe the workflow was made by persons with a brain wiring similar to mine and not yours?\nBut I will try to find the time to write a little about the passes and how they are set up (at least how I do it when I need them).\nvirgil Says:\nthanks alex, could you give me a simple example of how you’d set up a shadow pass? I just need to render my shadows separately, that’s all. I haven’t touched passes until now… and they seem very simple, but amazingly ilogical, meaning that whatever I do, more-or-less-nothing works now don’t tell me I’m stupid, please, because you have to admit there are weird things in rfm, like tweaking that alpha gain when rendering displacement… could they make it any more obscure? so what’s the secret behind rendering these passes anyway? it looks to me like I can only set up one pass… and it renders that pass, like the shadow pass… plus a beauty pass. I haven’t tried anything else yet. I presume it can render a diffuse pass plus the beauty pass, hehehe. because each time I try adding a different pass, it replaces my previous work… I can’t see that it’s adding that pass to the sandwich, it’s replacing the earlier pass, that’s all. so I’m always left with only one pass. but how do you render 10 passes, and what if you don’t want that beauty pass?\nand last thing would be that I worked really hard to get the shadow pass to work, and I don’t know how I did it. trying to emulate the process with a different file didn’t work. I really did the same thing… I think… like it works just when it feels like, hehehe. yeah, I know, I know, it’s simply my fault - I don’t understand it well but then another fact is that with RAT, and RfM as well, an insignificant little detail that you miss can result in complete disaster at rendertime. very sensitive. and I get nothing for free… well, with RfM I do RfM is much friendlier, so instead of tweaking things for days… I only need hours but errors seem to be inevitable. all the time. I’m not a rendering specialist and I have no one here to set it up for me, so I do all this stuff by myself.\n",

				"content_text": "As so many people from the MentalRay community seem to have a big problem with my motion blur test - and only that is seems, they don’t even see the parts, where I said good things about MentalRay - here is a small update with new images and the supposedly faster Rapid Motion Blur of MentalRay.\nWell, yes, I give you that Rapid Motion Blur is faster. But 19 minutes is still kind of slow in my book, especially with these artifacts Rapid Motion Blur introduced. But I am sure some MentalRay user will point me in the right direction how to get rid of them after reading this.\nAnd here is again a Renderman version for direct comparison. This time I even increased the sampling, so the Motion Blur is more smooth then before. Still considerably faster then MentalRay. 6 minutes.\nHow about this, we render the GI pass and maybe some reflections in MentalRay and then use this pass in Renderman, where we give is nice and fast Motion Blur?\nAs I said before: This is not a “My toy better then your toy!” comparison. It is a test to see when it makes sense to use which renderer. No, MentalRay is not the big daddy of all renderers. Neither is Renderman.\nNeed heavy GI and Reflections, but the scene is relatively static or doesn’t need Motion Blur for some reason? Hell, go with MentalRay any time! Even try it out on scenes without Raytracing. It might be faster then Renderman.\nBut when you need fast Displacements and/or Motion Blur, stay away from MentalRay and use Renderman (or blur in post when the scene allows it).\nThis is all about getting the job done. And I published this test to give some people hints about what to use when, as this is still a very often asked question, even more so with the new RfM plugin.\nPeople where interested, when I showed them this comparison and therefor, I made it available to a wider audience. …which of course took it apart and missed the point completely. But that was to be expected.\nAnyway before I drift into an endless monologue I better stop.\n####Following are the comments from the old blog\nvirgil Says:\nYou forget one thing. Renderman is not fast with motion blur (and depth of field) and displacement only, it’s especially fast with heavy scenes, it renders NURBS as pixels and it tesselates subdivisions very efficiently, so extremely heavy scenes, with a lot of geometry, textures, lights (but not shadows, shadows seem to be kind’a slow), and ideally without raytracing… render very fast, where mental ray would probably take forever. if you compare 2 simple scenes and add raytracing, yes, mental ray is probably going to be faster. if you compare 2 simple scenes without raytracing, I can bet renderman is going to be faster. if you have a complex scene though…. with a lot of objects and shaders and so on, renderman will still be fast, while mental ray will be crawling, at best…\nyou can’t compare these 2 technologies like you’d compare 2 renderman renderers or maya-software-render and mental-ray. in renderman, if you build your set efficiently, not wasting polygons I mean, and trying to have as many NURBS surfaces as possible where possible, and also not using raytracing, but deep shadows and skillfully placed lights, and so on… you can get a truly photographical render, with intricate surface detail and true dof and motion blur, all this in record time. mental ray is a fast raytracer and a very advanced and complex renderer, but in my book too… mental ray is overall outrageously slow.\none truly great thing about renderman btw is you never have to worry about tessellation (haven’t we seen countless examples of faceted 3D CGI?), all smooth surfaces will be 100% smooth at any resolution, no matter how close to the camera. this alone was, for me, the reason to start learning RAT, and start using prman with Maya. If you also use procedural textures for example you can be totally resolution independent. this is BIG!\nGuillermoZS Says:\nHi, well I don´t want to be rude but I think you have done a VERY partial review…\nAt first, Renderman is an scanliner and Mental Ray is a raytracer, so , obviously, renderman will be better in scanline tasks (shadow mpas, dof, motion blur,…) and render man is much better in raytracing tasks (relfections, refraction, GI,…)\nIn your review you seem to “forget” (no offense) very important things where MR is better than RfM:\nSubSurface Scattering: No comparison, MR is MUCH better than RfM here. Reflections and Refractions: again, another MR strong point. RfM sucks for this. GI and IBL: … the same as above… As a conclusion, none of them is better than the other, it just depends of what you want to do.\nCheers!\nAlexK Says:\nWell, no problem GuillermoZS, I don’t think you are rude at all. That’s why I have comments enabled, because I want to hear other peoples comments.\nI do not entirely see it that way.\nBoth renderers are hybrid-renderers nowadays. Only Renderman was first developed as a Scanline and MentalRay as a Raytrace renderer. And I don’t think that means MentalRay automatically has to be better at Raytracing. In fact for simple Scanline setups MentalRay beats Renderman. It is in the complexity of scenes that Renderman really collects its points. (A complexity which I didn’t even start to touch in my tests.)\nI am also not sure if you read the real review, where I also list a few things where MR is better then Renderman. I don’t think however that Subsurface scattering is one on them though.\nSSS is way easier to set up with RfM. I have yet to convince the Maya implementation of MentalRay to succeed in writing the MentalRay-Textures used for SSS. A process I don’t even have to think about in RfM.\nI mentioned several times in this and the old blog post (and the cgTalk forum) that MentalRay is better at Reflections and Refractions. I don’t see where I forgot that. Try reading my posts again.\nWell, GI and IBL…did you really read my test and the conclusions??\nIt seems to me you just skimmed the articles and saw that I favor Renderman. I clearly state that MR has its purpose and try not to dismiss it.\nPlease correct me if I misunderstood you GuillermoZS.\nmasterblasterofdisaster Says:\nA difficulty most people new to mental ray encounter is dealing with the maddening number of tweakable render parameters.\nFor example, correct BSP settings alone can have a massive impact on the render time. In tuning the BSP, you’ll find that the optimal settings versus “inappropriate” settings can affect the render time by several orders of a magnitude (in pathological cases, render times of 30 minutes versus several hours can be observed). A further difficulty is that good BSP depth and width values aren’t always easy to intuit: you’ve often got to run tests and then decide what’s best. BSP values for motion blur will be different from non-motion blurred renders as well. If you run a test plotting render time against the axes “depth” and “width” on a 3D graph (use excel, for instance), you’ll find a bowl-like shape plotted out - the bottom of the bowl (ie lowest time) will indicate your optimal BSP settings.\nI could go on… there are many more tricks to know in order to properly and meaningfully compare the two renderers.\nMy 2 cents: renderman is stuck in the 90’s - raytracing is essentially bolted on top of the fundamentally raytrace-unfriendly REYES architecture (ever wonder why the prman trace() function took over a decade to actually become implemented? It’s been in the prman specification from the beginning, after all!) If you don’t need raytracing and global illumination, then use it and enjoy, as it does all the old-school stuff quite well - however, prepare to make some ugly hacks in large scale production requiring tracing or other global illumination effects. Mental Ray certainly has it’s shortcomings, complexity being one, but as such it’s incredibly flexible and will get the job done. AIR is probably a good compromise, especially if you want a RIB compliant renderer that’ll do all that stuff well.\nAlexK Says:\nHey, nice input masterblasterofdisaster. Thanks for taking the time.\nActually I think the complexity and thousands of knobs in MentalRay for Maya are the one thing that slow me down most. I need to produce my stuff fast (sometimes within hours), so I absolutely cannot waste time tweaking away. A thing that seems to be necessary with MentalRay (why oh why are the defaults so inefficient?).\nOf course Renderman itself offers many possibilities, too, but the Renderman for Maya implementation is way less crowded and “just works” (most of the time anyway).\n",

				"content_text": "Finally I found the time to do my little Renderman - MentalRay comparison. I used Maya 6.5 on a Mac OS X - which comes with MentalRay 3.4.1.5 and the Pixar Renderman for Maya plugin version 1.2 evaluation.\nAs test scenes, I used the tutorial scenes that come with the Renderman for Maya plugin. I am aware, that this might be a bit unfair to MentalRay, but my reasoning is that the features I tested should work in both renderers and the test scenes where not specifially pro Renderman anyway. I also tweaked the scenes to get the best out of Renderman and MentalRay, so as to not penalize either one.\nThe tested features where:\nDisplacement Motion Blur Instances (as a side effect of the Motion Blur test) Depth of Field Fur and soft shadows Reflections Global Illumination For a side by side comparison of rendered output and rendertimes please download the following PDF → (link: rmanvsmr_forWeb.pdf text: Renderman vs MentalRay comparison)\nUpdate: MasterZap over at cgTalk pointed me to a few shortcomings in my tests. First he is of the opinion, that I should have used MentalRay’s “Rapid Motion Blur”. Every time I tested this feature, I either got artefacts or it was not significantly faster, so I just didn’t use it here. Second, he points out that MentalRay has something similar to Renderman’s DeepShadow Maps. I forgot about them completely. My bad.\n###Displacement\nBoth renderers can handle really fine displacement really well. However, Renderman wins this contest hands down, as it does displacements with virtually no extra overhead. The surfaces get subdivided into Micropolygons anyway, so the renderer already has the neccessary geometry for displacment. MentalRay however doesn’t handle the large masses of geometry as well and it is much more hassle to tweak it (one has 4 different knobs per object to fiddle around with in MentalRay).\n###Motion Blur…\nNow Motion Blur is MentalRays (and most of the other renderers out there) Achilles heel. They just don’t cut it. Slow, grainy, memory intensive. That is the common knowledge about 3D Motion Blur.\nThis is definitely not true for Renderman. Man this renderer flies through it with a quality that is amazing! And the really nice thing about it is, that depending on the scene, Renderman gets even faster with Motion Blur. That is due to the fact, that one is able to give Renderman a second quality parameter for Motion Blur. So you just lower the quality where you won’t see it anyway (meaning in the blurry areas).\nMentalRay on the other hand…just sucks…big time. No wonder people have such an expression of panic in their eyes, whenever rendered Motion Blur is the topic. If I didn’t know it better, I would not touch 3D Motion Blur either.\n###…and Instances Rendering the Motion Blur scene without blur, a severe bug in the Pixar plugin is revealed. It renders instances way slower then it should. That is a known bug and the big brother Pixar Renderman doesn’t suffer from this.\nNevertheless, at the current time MentalRay wins this category easily and superfast.\n###Depth of Field\nBoth engines work nearly the same here. Nothing special to report. Fast and nice.\n###Fur and soft shadows\nWell, this one I would say is a matter of personal taste. Renderman renders the fur best with DeepShadowMaps, which is like a shadow map, but with more bells and whistles. MentalRay doesn’t have DeepShadows and has to use Raytracing. That means, MentalRay shadows are always sharp and if you want them soft, you need more samples (=rendertime). The situation is the other way round with Renderman and DeepShadows. The default shadows look a bit blurry, but render fast and to increase the sharpness you have to increase the ShadowMap size and therefor increase rendertime.\nI’d say it’s a draw. If you like sharp shadows, go with MentalRay fur. If you like softer shadows (and I do, as real world shadows are never really sharp) go with Renderman.\n###Reflections\nNow we are entering the domain of MentalRay. It was built from the start as a Raytracing engine. And we can see that instantly in the rendertimes. Renderman however lived happily without Raytracing for ten years (or more) and has just recently (with version 11 I think) got the ability to trace rays.\n###Global Illumination\nSame here. MentalRay wins hands down. It feels right at home with tracing stuff.\n###…but…\nRemember the Motion Blur advantage? Well, it is even more evident with Raytracing. MentalRay may rule with Raytracing, but it is unbelieveably slow with Motion Blur. And it gets rediculous with Raytracing/Global Illumination and Motion Blur at the same time.\nRenderman however, still slow, gets a big speed boost from lowering the quality in the blurred regions. Again fantastic!\n###Fazit\nSo as a conclusion I would say, that both renderers have their areas where they shine and it would be a wise thing to know when to use which. All sympathies aside picking the best tool for the job. And if you do not need Motion Blur (or very subtle one that can be faked in post) go MentalRay, but for most other cases I would go Renderman any time.\nFor a side by side comparison of rendered output and rendertimes please download the following PDF → Renderman vs MentalRay comparison\n",

				"content_text": "Is CG dull and boring. I asked this question in my last post. Well, since then I have seen a recent production called [“Elephants Dream“] 1, it is the first big project released, completely done with open source software, in particular [Blender] 2, the open source 3D suite. It shows that Blender is able to produce nice stuff, but it also validates my thoughts concerning dull CG.\nFirst, I didn’t get the story. That might not be my fault, but I was never a fan of these artistic movies. Have something to say? Better make sure people understand, what you are saying. Have nothing to say? Then shut up! But that is just me.\nSecond, the movie is everything I talked about last time. It tries to look realistic, but fails in doing so. And because it fails, all it’s flaws become all the more obvious. Sad but true. I was distracted by the stiffness of the characters all the time. And I mean not only in motion, but also in the looks. The makers tried to be so true to nature, that everything feels like true…plastic.\n###So, is CG doomed to become more boring every day?\nLuckily not. While I was very disappointed by the Blender movie, I also found some marvelous examples of animation from some French students (thanks to Peter Soderbaum from Passive/Agressive). These movies saved my day and more. They gave me hope again, that somewhere out there are still creative heads, that try do lift their work out of the ordinary. Go and take a look at [Burning Safari] 3, a great funny short film. It has a great story, superb timing and a really nice look, that fits perfectly for the setting.\nAnd while you are there, you should not miss [the other movies of this years students of Gobelins l’ecole de l’image] 4. I personally liked the Pirates movie best - even though it is not (plain) CG. But I just love the ending. Check it out -\u0026gt; [Pyrats] 5\n",

In [their post] 2 they review several songs that were… er… well… mutilated to make a quick buck of the world cup. “From London to Berlin” actually made a reasonable standing. Thanks guys!\nI am aware that this was no high quality piece, but believe me, it was at least a challenge from the technical side. And I actually think it works better then the original version.

				"title": "3D Rendering Choices",
				"content_text": "There are a lot of nice rendering choices out there. The range goes from free - like Aqsis, Blender or Yafray - to bundled renderers that come with the 3D package of choice - Maya software renderer or Lightwave come to mind - to seperate high-end renderers - like MentalRay (although that comes bundled with a lot of big players nowadays) or Renderman. Which one to choose? And which one is actually affordable? That is indeed a tough question. The guys at ZAON studios have [a nice overview of what makes a renderer good] 1. It is all about what the renderer is supposed to be used for. Nothing more nothing less.\nIn the case of Fridthjof Film, we need a renderer that is able to be as fast as possible, while doing a great job with fine detail. Flickering is one of the major issues we deal with. As we are working with Maya, MentalRay seems to be the logical choice, but it is damn slow when it comes to make fine details really smooth. MentalRay doesn’t allow to adjust the pixel sampling independent from the sampling of shaders, which makes us increase overall render time when we only needed to increase the render time of one parameter - and that in the long run increases the render times into unacceptable regions. Sad but true.\nNow Renderman seems to do the trick, which I already new from the start (being pro-Renderman for quite some time now). The crux with that is, that there is not really a good bridge to Renderman for small companies that cannot afford to program their own. Sure there are free Renderman renderers, but what good are they if I only have an interface only I can use (as the other 3D guys are not as technically oriented). Even [3DeLight] 2 which has a [nice interface recently] 3 is not up to par in integration with Pixars newest coup - [Pixar’s Renderman for Maya] 4.\nRenderman for Maya seems like the ideal option for a small studio like F-Film, where we are three guys right now — and only one (me) with previous Renderman experience. It might miss some nice features like RIB im- and export, but that is something I could live with, because the prime feature is usability by non-technical 3D artists.\nBut then again, a license for Pixars Maya plugin is not exactly cheap with $995,- per license. A major block on the road to bring this baby to the company - at least as far as my boss is concerned. I need to set up a test case (at least one) to show him the advantages and show him that they outweigh by far the disadvantages. Well, I guess there I have my next step.\n",

				"title": "Directory Structures and Workflow - Part 01",
				"content_text": "Last week we spoke about naming conventions, which got inspired by a topic covered on [Lifehacker] 1 and [43 Folders] 2. A great start to a more streamlined workflow. But what good is a great filename, when you are unable to find your files in the chaotic folder structure you might have?\nFor exactly this reason we will talk about how to get an optimized folder structure for multi-media projects. I will obviously have a bias to look at it from a compositors/3D guys/VFX supervisors view, but I am also able to accommodate you editors and other departments.\nWhat we will end up with is an understanding of what is important in a file and folder structure, so you are able to easily adjust the two templates, that we will discuss, to your needs.\n###Template No.1 - General purpose environment\nThis template is geared to a more editing heavy workflow as it seems to be the case in most small TV commercial shops. It also has its room for 3D and compositing, but those are mere means to pimp the editing.\nAs the main structure we divide into:\nscene files materials sound output provals scratch temp ####Scene files\nObviously all the saved scenes from the involved programs — like FinalCut, Maya, shake or AfterEffects — go in here into their own subfolder. Now these may vary depending on your tools, but at them moment our scene files substructure looks like:\nFinalCut DVD Maya Shake Combustion Compressor Other Temp As you notice there is a temp folder just like in the main structure. These are supposed to be the brainstorm areas of the folder structure. Everything that goes in here is just dabbling and will not be backed up and the Temp folders will be deleted at the end of the project.\nNow depending on the tool you might want or need to go deeper with your folders. For example, Maya has its own project structure. You could use the default one in the above Maya directory or you could adjust it, so it takes advantage of the folder template we are just creating — which would be a wise choice, because you don’t want to have several folders with the same meaning hanging around.\n####Materials\nMaterials is everything coming in from the outside world. Graphics from the client, video clips, sound bytes, word documents and storyboards. All that goes in here.\nAgain depending on your individual needs you may subdivide further into:\nGraphics Documents Fonts Subtitles Video Temp Should be pretty clear what to use when, right?\n####Sound\nOn most projects there will be sound involved. Music, sound effects, maybe speak. All that goes in here. Again within its own folder, like this:\nFinal Mix Speak Music Sound Effects DVD soundfiles Temp ####Output\nNow this is our catchall folder for renderings. We render uncompressed material for archiving. We also render back and forth from editing to VFX. The DVD department needs to receive files, etc.\nA folder structure like this looks reasonable:\nUncompressed -\u0026gt;VFX \u0026lt;-VFX DVD Sound Temp The first folder catches all the uncompressed output from editing. -\u0026gt;VFX is all the stuff that goes into the VFX department and needs 3D or compositing effects applied. The VFX department then renders back to editing (\u0026lt;-VFX) the finished effects.\nWhat the VFX department does when it has to render intermediate files you ask? That is a very good question. There are two ways to handle this in my opinion.\nThe correct way would be to render all the layers and pre-comps into Output/-\u0026gt;VFX because it is something that goes again into the VFX land. I also tend to create a 3Drenders and a 2Drenders folder, so I can split up the sub-folders and files. Otherwise it might get a bit too crowded.\nThe lazy way would be to stay in the \u0026lt;-VFX folder. That has the advantage of staying in one folder all the time. Which means human error can be minimized. It happens all too easily that you accidentally render in the wrong VFX folder. And if you have to switch between the two folder (-\u0026gt;VFX and \u0026lt;-VFX) all the time, then it might happen quite easily.\nDVD is obviously the folder where all the DVD files belong. All the m2v and m2a and vob’s and whatnot files only the DVD department can make use of.\n-\u0026gt;Sound catches all the files that go to the sound editing as reference files.\nAnd Temp is the same as in all the other locations.\n####Approvals\nThis is just a simple folder where all the files the customer needs to approve are saved. Preview clips and such.\n####Scratch\nThis folder is similar to temp, but has a special meaning for the FinalCup folks. It is the folder where FinalCut renders all the internal caching and pre-render files.\n####Temp\nI said enough about the meaning of the Temp directories in the other paragraphs I think. As the name implies, the Temp folders are there for dabbling and trying things out. It will not be backed up and it also will be deleted at the end of the project.\nIt is a sandbox, a playground to try things out.\n####That’s all folks\nThat was a rundown on a basic production ready file and folder structure. Combine it with the naming convention I showed you and you have a nearly bullet proof system for all the basic needs of a production.\nAnd of course don’t be shy to adjust this template to your needs. This system lives from its ability to blend into the working environment. The idea is to make handling files in a project easy and fast, while minimizing the potential sources of human error.\nThis is by no means the ultimate word on folder structures and if you have improvements to the above, I am all ears.\n",

				"content_text": "[Keith Lango] 1 has an interesting article on his blog concerning [CG pictures/movies and how they have become boring] 2. Keith is of the opinion that the CG look has kind of worn of. We no longer have the “wow” moments when watching a nice full CG movie. And I must say I know what he means.\nNowadays every guy in the backrow knows about 3D and VFX and that it isn’t a secret art. And that kind of pisses me off. I liked to do magic with pictures. I love the expression on the faces of people watching my (or any cool stuff for that matter) and be completely blown away by the uniqueness or pure beauty of effects. Maybe I am a nerd, but it was fun.\nToday all we do is making stuff realistic. Yeah! Bring it on! Let’s do stuff like we see it every day without CG!\nI have only one word for that: boring\nI really am fed up with someone coming to me saying: “Hey can you do a magazine or CD or whatever object floating in an undefined space doing normal stuff (like opening and closing)? …oh and by the way, can you make it as realistic as possible?”\nIt is kind of frustrating to work within bounds of one world, when all the candy is in the other world - the CG world - where we can do stuff that is unrealistic and exaggerated.\nOr is it just me and Keith?\n###Following are the comments from the old blog\nstickman Says:\nWell, count me in. NPR has long been neglected, with endless raytracing programs on the market yet hardly any true NPR renderers. Hard to believe, for two reasons:\nLook. A stylistically relevant yet unique look draws an audience. Madagascar shows the potential. So do most all the coffee-table art books of “boring3D” films where the artistic development looks SO much better than the final version. Efficiency. The last 10% of finalizing a Pixar-look film can comprise 90% of the effort - just think of hair groomers, particle specialists, geometry doctors. NPR looks are much more forgiving in this last phase and can allow for quicker finaling without compromising the visual impact. In short: we need releases of software like “JOT”. For indy film-makers, students and even the big studios.\nAlexK Says:\nHi David,\nI have never heard of JOT. Can you give me a link for it, please? Sounds interesting.\nstickman Says:\njot: jot.cs.princeton.edu\nalso check here for someone doing some recent research. Its just not fair that this ype of software isn’t ready for production use…\nwww.rendering.de/forum/vie\u0026hellip;\nand another link: visgraph.cs.ust.hk/MoXi/\nAlexK Says:\nWow, JOT seems really awesome.
