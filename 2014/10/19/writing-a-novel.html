		<p>I&rsquo;m actually in the middle of reading Mike Montero&rsquo;s <a href="http:://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job"><em>Design is a Job</em></a>—which is recommended reading as well, by the way—but I couldn&rsquo;t pass this one without at least peeking in. And it didn&rsquo;t stay at peeking. I read through the whole book in one sitting. It reads very well, is entertaining and maybe, just maybe, it&rsquo;ll motivate me to start writing more again. Which is the goal of this whole <em>new blog</em> thing after all.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://davidhewson.com/writing-a-novel-with-ulysses/">get it</a>. I can highly recommend it.</p>
