		<p>You. Yes, you, the one person that has visited this site in the last year. You will likely not have noticed, but this site is once again looking 100% different again.</p>
<p>I got bit by the CSS bug again a couple of weeks ago, got myself <a href="http://www.abookapart.com" title="A Book Apart">some new books on web design and content strategy</a> and a new <a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com" title="Ulysses III">writing app</a> and here we are.</p>
<p>The new look is the barest minimum of chrome. I want you to focus on the words on this site. I might not be a great writer or even a good one, but I do appreciate a clean design and the power of words. That’s why I come back to this blog time and time again, even after I have seemingly abandoned it.</p>
<p>This time around I am not only trying post more often (like that worked so well before), but also to link to stuff I find interesting without much ado. That will hopefully to get me to spend more time with the site and motivate me to write longer articles again.</p>
