         	<p>One thing I always wondered about game development: in order to make the game (and test the game) wouldn‘t the game developer need to be the best player for the game as well? I mean, how do you make a super hard game without being able to play through and best the most difficult parts? Or come up with the hardest puzzles? Meaning game developers would need to be the best gamers as well?</p>

<p>Serves 4</p>
<p>Takes at least 3 hours, better more</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 kg beef</li>
<li>800g onions</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic</li>
<li>1 teaspoon caraway</li>
<li>1 tablespoon marjoram</li>
<li>4 tablespoon paprika powder</li>
<li>1 tablespoon (white wine) vinegar</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon tomato paste</li>
<li>lard or sunflower seed oil</li>
<li>broth</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dice the onions into rough cubes.</li>
<li>Dice the beef into 2-4 cm cubes</li>
<li>Heat the lard/oil and fry the onions slowly to a dark brown. Don’t burn them!</li>
<li>Purée the onions with a mixer or immersion blender</li>
<li>Add the cut up garlic, caraway, marjoram, paprika, and vinegar and mix well</li>
<li>add a bit of water and let it simmer for 1,5h to let the flavours develop</li>
<li>After the 1,5h is up, add the meat and fill with water or broth. The amount is a bit to taste. The meat should still be visible and not swim in water. Add too much and the sauce gets too thin, add too little and you can always thin it later.</li>
<li>Simmer for 3 hours or more on low heat. The longer, the better. In the end, you should have a nice deep red colour and a layer of fat swimming on the top.</li>
<li>Stir everything to mix in the fat.</li>
<li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best prepared the day before. Or even two days before. It gets better with every re-heating.</p>
<p>Eat with baguette, pasta or spätzle. Some heathens eat it with rice.</p>

Also I have issues with pointing my domain (alexanderkucera.com) to my Micro.blog page. But I am slowly chipping away at my issues. I am sure I will prevail. Eventually…</p>
