It means recognizing that for most casual learning and curiosity, the best knowledge management system is often no system at all ‚Äì just the confidence that when you need to know something again, you'll be able to find it.\n\nMaybe I'll find a genuine use for Craft over the next six months, or maybe I'll learn to be comfortable with the fact that a beautifully designed tool doesn't need to become part of my life just because I have access to it. The goal isn't to become an information processing machine. It's to remain curious and engaged while accepting that not every interesting thing needs to become a project. Sometimes the most productive thing you can do with information is simply let it go.\n\n(The images in this post were created with MidJourney.)\n",

Try again later.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It forces you to stop. Step away. Move around. Let your brain relax.</p>\n<p>I used to curse these interruptions. Now I see them differently. They&rsquo;re mandatory wellness breaks. Digital interventions preventing coding binges.</p>\n<p>For me, with my health condition, these forced breaks are especially crucial. I need that movement. That mental reset. Without rate limits, I&rsquo;d code myself into a hole.</p>\n<p>The AI companies probably didn&rsquo;t design rate limits for our health. They&rsquo;re managing server costs and preventing abuse. But the side effect is profound.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re protecting us from ourselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-productivity-paradox\">The Productivity Paradox</h2>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the kicker. Recent research found that experienced developers using AI tools actually showed 19% decreased productivity on complex projects. Despite feeling 20% more productive.</p>\n<p>We think we&rsquo;re coding faster. But we&rsquo;re not. The AI creates an illusion of speed while introducing subtle inefficiencies.</p>\n<p>Rate limits might be saving us from more than burnout. They might be saving us from counterproductive coding sessions that feel amazing but deliver less value.</p>\n<p>Those forced pauses give us time to reflect. Is this code actually better? Am I solving the right problem? Sometimes the answer is no.</p>\n<h2 id=\"embracing-the-pause\">Embracing the Pause</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m learning to reframe rate limits. Instead of obstacles, they&rsquo;re features. Built-in wisdom from systems that know we can&rsquo;t self-regulate.</p>\n<p>But we shouldn&rsquo;t rely only on external limits. We need internal boundaries too.</p>\n<p>Set timers. Take real breaks. Go for walks. Talk to humans. Remember the world beyond the screen exists.</p>\n<p>The AI will wait. Your projects will survive. Your health won&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>Rate limits aren&rsquo;t just about server resources. They&rsquo;re about human resources. Your energy, focus, and wellbeing.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re reminders that even in our AI-powered future, we&rsquo;re still human. We still need rest, movement, and connection.</p>\n<p>So next time you hit a rate limit, don&rsquo;t curse it. Thank it.</p>\n<p>It might just be saving your life.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>What&rsquo;s your relationship with AI coding tools? Do you find them addictive? How do you maintain healthy coding habits? I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts.</em></p>\n",

Try again later.\" \n\nIt forces you to stop. Step away. Move around. Let your brain relax.\n\nI used to curse these interruptions. Now I see them differently. They're mandatory wellness breaks. Digital interventions preventing coding binges.\n\nFor me, with my health condition, these forced breaks are especially crucial. I need that movement. That mental reset. Without rate limits, I'd code myself into a hole.\n\nThe AI companies probably didn't design rate limits for our health. They're managing server costs and preventing abuse. But the side effect is profound.\n\nThey're protecting us from ourselves.\n\n## The Productivity Paradox\n\nHere's the kicker. Recent research found that experienced developers using AI tools actually showed 19% decreased productivity on complex projects. Despite feeling 20% more productive.\n\nWe think we're coding faster. But we're not. The AI creates an illusion of speed while introducing subtle inefficiencies.\n\nRate limits might be saving us from more than burnout. They might be saving us from counterproductive coding sessions that feel amazing but deliver less value.\n\nThose forced pauses give us time to reflect. Is this code actually better? Am I solving the right problem? Sometimes the answer is no.\n\n## Embracing the Pause\n\nI'm learning to reframe rate limits. Instead of obstacles, they're features. Built-in wisdom from systems that know we can't self-regulate.\n\nBut we shouldn't rely only on external limits. We need internal boundaries too.\n\nSet timers. Take real breaks. Go for walks. Talk to humans. Remember the world beyond the screen exists.\n\nThe AI will wait. Your projects will survive. Your health won't.\n\nRate limits aren't just about server resources. They're about human resources. Your energy, focus, and wellbeing.\n\nThey're reminders that even in our AI-powered future, we're still human. We still need rest, movement, and connection.\n\nSo next time you hit a rate limit, don't curse it. Thank it.\n\nIt might just be saving your life.\n\n---\n\n*What's your relationship with AI coding tools? Do you find them addictive? How do you maintain healthy coding habits? I'd love to hear your thoughts.*\n",

				"content_html": "<p>For anyone thinking &ldquo;vibe coding&rdquo; results in bad quality code or code slop, let me set the record straight.</p>\n<p>I spend about 50-70% of my vibe coding time refactoring and running code reviews to make sure everything is up to snuff. I could easily skip that step and have something that <em>just</em> works. But my standards are higher than that.</p>\n<p>The misconception comes from people who think vibe coding means throwing prompts at an LLM and calling it a day. That&rsquo;s not vibe coding. That&rsquo;s just being lazy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-vibe-coding-actually-means\">What Vibe Coding Actually Means</h2>\n<p>To me, vibe coding is more akin to being the designer or product manager while the LLM is the coder. I give it a task and once it&rsquo;s done, I review the task and give it corrections and suggestions on how to improve the code and what to do next.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s never about set and forget. It&rsquo;s strictly about increased productivity and accessing a knowledge base that knows more about coding than I will ever have.</p>\n<p>Think about it this way: when you work with a junior developer, you don&rsquo;t just hand them a task and walk away. You review their work, provide feedback, suggest improvements, and guide them through iterations. The same principle applies to working with LLMs.</p>\n<p>The difference? The LLM has access to patterns and solutions from millions of codebases. But it still needs human oversight to ensure quality and context.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-actual-workflow\">My Actual Workflow</h2>\n<p>Let me get specific about how this works in practice. I mainly use Claude Code, and I have it set to planning mode for most of my inputs until I&rsquo;m happy with the plan Claude comes up with. Only then do I allow it to execute the plan.</p>\n<p>This two-stage process is crucial. Instead of jumping straight into code generation, Claude first presents a detailed plan of what it intends to do. I can review the approach, suggest modifications, point out potential issues, or redirect entirely before a single line of code gets written.</p>\n<p>This planning phase catches problems early. Maybe Claude misunderstood a requirement. Maybe there&rsquo;s a better architectural approach. Maybe it&rsquo;s missing a critical edge case. Catching these issues in the planning stage saves massive amounts of time later.</p>\n<p>I also use an MCP server called <a href=\"https://github.com/PV-Bhat/vibe-check-mcp-server/tree/main\">Vibe Check</a> and have Claude check against it regularly. It really helps to keep Claude on track throughout the development process.</p>\n<p>The Vibe Check server acts like a continuous validation system. It helps ensure that Claude stays aligned with my coding standards and project requirements as we work through iterations. Think of it as a persistent memory system that reminds Claude of what we&rsquo;ve established works well and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>On top of that, I use a series of prompts that remind Claude how I like it to code and constantly update its coding guidelines along the way. This isn&rsquo;t just about syntax preferences‚Äîit&rsquo;s about architectural patterns, error handling approaches, testing strategies, and documentation standards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-quality-control-reality\">The Quality Control Reality</h2>\n<p>Recent research from 2024 shows why this structured approach matters. Studies found an 8-fold increase in duplicated code blocks when developers rely on AI assistance without proper review. Code churn rates have also increased dramatically, with much of the generated code being discarded shortly after creation.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t an AI problem. It&rsquo;s a process problem.</p>\n<p>When I work with Claude, here&rsquo;s what actually happens:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I define the task with clear requirements</li>\n<li>Claude generates a detailed plan (not code yet)</li>\n<li>I review and refine the plan until it&rsquo;s solid</li>\n<li>Claude executes the plan and generates code</li>\n<li>I review every line for logic, efficiency, and maintainability</li>\n<li>Claude runs Vibe Check validation throughout the process</li>\n<li>I provide specific feedback on improvements</li>\n<li>We iterate until the code meets my standards</li>\n<li>I run additional tests and refactoring passes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t faster because I&rsquo;m cutting corners. It&rsquo;s faster because I&rsquo;m leveraging a tool that can generate solutions I might not have considered, then applying human judgment to refine them within a structured framework.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-productivity-paradox\">The Productivity Paradox</h2>\n<p>Research shows mixed results on AI coding productivity. Some studies report 26% gains for less experienced developers, while others show 19% decreases for experienced developers in complex scenarios.</p>\n<p>The key difference? How you use the tool.</p>\n<p>Less experienced developers benefit because they&rsquo;re getting exposure to patterns and solutions they haven&rsquo;t seen before. Experienced developers struggle when they try to use AI for complex, context-heavy tasks that require deep understanding of existing codebases.</p>\n<p>But when experienced developers use AI strategically‚Äîwith proper planning phases, validation systems, and iterative refinement‚Äîthe productivity gains are substantial.</p>\n<p>The strategic advantage isn&rsquo;t just speed. It&rsquo;s access to a broader knowledge base. I can ask Claude about obscure APIs, edge cases, or optimization techniques that I might not remember or know about. Then I can evaluate and adapt those suggestions based on my experience and requirements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beyond-set-and-forget\">Beyond Set-and-Forget</h2>\n<p>The &ldquo;never set and forget&rdquo; principle is crucial because it maintains the human element that makes code truly valuable.</p>\n<p>When I&rsquo;m reviewing Claude-generated code, I&rsquo;m looking for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logic errors and edge cases</li>\n<li>Performance optimizations</li>\n<li>Code readability and maintainability</li>\n<li>Integration with existing systems</li>\n<li>Security considerations</li>\n<li>Future extensibility</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The LLM might generate functionally correct code, but it doesn&rsquo;t understand the broader context of your project, your team&rsquo;s coding standards, or your long-term architectural goals.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s where the human comes in. I&rsquo;m not just checking if the code works. I&rsquo;m ensuring it works well within the larger system.</p>\n<p>The continuous prompting and guideline updates serve as a feedback loop. As we work through a project, Claude learns my specific preferences and patterns. But this learning is guided and validated by human oversight, not left to chance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future-of-developer-roles\">The Future of Developer Roles</h2>\n<p>This approach fundamentally changes what it means to be a developer. Instead of spending time on routine implementations, you&rsquo;re focusing on architecture, design decisions, and quality assurance.</p>\n<p>You become the architect and the LLM becomes the builder. But architects don&rsquo;t just hand over blueprints and disappear. They oversee construction, make adjustments, and ensure the final result meets specifications.</p>\n<p>This shift requires maintaining your technical skills and architectural thinking. You need to understand code deeply enough to evaluate what the LLM produces. You need to know good patterns from bad ones. You need to understand the trade-offs in different approaches.</p>\n<p>The developers who struggle with AI assistance are often those who try to use it as a replacement for their own knowledge rather than an amplifier of it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-strategic-advantage\">The Strategic Advantage</h2>\n<p>When done right, vibe coding isn&rsquo;t about lowering standards. It&rsquo;s about raising them.</p>\n<p>Because you&rsquo;re not bogged down in routine implementation details, you can focus more attention on code quality, system design, and user experience. You can explore more alternatives because the cost of prototyping is lower.</p>\n<p>You can also tackle more ambitious projects because you have a force multiplier for the routine parts of development.</p>\n<p>But this only works if you maintain rigorous standards for the output. The moment you start accepting &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; code because it was faster to generate, you&rsquo;ve fallen into the trap that gives vibe coding a bad reputation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Vibe coding isn&rsquo;t about replacing human judgment with AI automation. It&rsquo;s about strategic collaboration where AI handles routine tasks and pattern generation while humans provide oversight, refinement, and architectural guidance.</p>\n<p>The quality of your code depends on the quality of your review process, not the tool you use to generate it. Whether you&rsquo;re working with an LLM or a junior developer, the principles remain the same: clear requirements, thorough review, iterative improvement, and unwavering standards.</p>\n<p>The developers who succeed with AI assistance are those who understand this distinction. They&rsquo;re not looking for a replacement for their skills. They&rsquo;re looking for a tool that amplifies their capabilities while maintaining their responsibility for the final product.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s what vibe coding really is. And when done right, it produces better code, not worse.</p>\n",

Catching these issues in the planning stage saves massive amounts of time later.\n\nI also use an MCP server called [Vibe Check](https://github.com/PV-Bhat/vibe-check-mcp-server/tree/main) and have Claude check against it regularly. It really helps to keep Claude on track throughout the development process.\n\nThe Vibe Check server acts like a continuous validation system. It helps ensure that Claude stays aligned with my coding standards and project requirements as we work through iterations. Think of it as a persistent memory system that reminds Claude of what we've established works well and what doesn't.\n\nOn top of that, I use a series of prompts that remind Claude how I like it to code and constantly update its coding guidelines along the way. This isn't just about syntax preferences‚Äîit's about architectural patterns, error handling approaches, testing strategies, and documentation standards.\n\n## The Quality Control Reality\n\nRecent research from 2024 shows why this structured approach matters. Studies found an 8-fold increase in duplicated code blocks when developers rely on AI assistance without proper review. Code churn rates have also increased dramatically, with much of the generated code being discarded shortly after creation.\n\nThis isn't an AI problem. It's a process problem.\n\nWhen I work with Claude, here's what actually happens:\n\n1. I define the task with clear requirements\n2. Claude generates a detailed plan (not code yet)\n3. I review and refine the plan until it's solid\n4. Claude executes the plan and generates code\n5. I review every line for logic, efficiency, and maintainability\n6. Claude runs Vibe Check validation throughout the process\n7. I provide specific feedback on improvements\n8. We iterate until the code meets my standards\n9. I run additional tests and refactoring passes\n\nThis isn't faster because I'm cutting corners. It's faster because I'm leveraging a tool that can generate solutions I might not have considered, then applying human judgment to refine them within a structured framework.\n\n## The Productivity Paradox\n\nResearch shows mixed results on AI coding productivity. Some studies report 26% gains for less experienced developers, while others show 19% decreases for experienced developers in complex scenarios.\n\nThe key difference? How you use the tool.\n\nLess experienced developers benefit because they're getting exposure to patterns and solutions they haven't seen before. Experienced developers struggle when they try to use AI for complex, context-heavy tasks that require deep understanding of existing codebases.\n\nBut when experienced developers use AI strategically‚Äîwith proper planning phases, validation systems, and iterative refinement‚Äîthe productivity gains are substantial.\n\nThe strategic advantage isn't just speed. It's access to a broader knowledge base. I can ask Claude about obscure APIs, edge cases, or optimization techniques that I might not remember or know about. Then I can evaluate and adapt those suggestions based on my experience and requirements.\n\n## Beyond Set-and-Forget\n\nThe \"never set and forget\" principle is crucial because it maintains the human element that makes code truly valuable.\n\nWhen I'm reviewing Claude-generated code, I'm looking for:\n- Logic errors and edge cases\n- Performance optimizations  \n- Code readability and maintainability\n- Integration with existing systems\n- Security considerations\n- Future extensibility\n\nThe LLM might generate functionally correct code, but it doesn't understand the broader context of your project, your team's coding standards, or your long-term architectural goals.\n\nThat's where the human comes in. I'm not just checking if the code works. I'm ensuring it works well within the larger system.\n\nThe continuous prompting and guideline updates serve as a feedback loop. As we work through a project, Claude learns my specific preferences and patterns. But this learning is guided and validated by human oversight, not left to chance.\n\n## The Future of Developer Roles\n\nThis approach fundamentally changes what it means to be a developer. Instead of spending time on routine implementations, you're focusing on architecture, design decisions, and quality assurance.\n\nYou become the architect and the LLM becomes the builder. But architects don't just hand over blueprints and disappear. They oversee construction, make adjustments, and ensure the final result meets specifications.\n\nThis shift requires maintaining your technical skills and architectural thinking. You need to understand code deeply enough to evaluate what the LLM produces. You need to know good patterns from bad ones. You need to understand the trade-offs in different approaches.\n\nThe developers who struggle with AI assistance are often those who try to use it as a replacement for their own knowledge rather than an amplifier of it.\n\n## The Strategic Advantage\n\nWhen done right, vibe coding isn't about lowering standards. It's about raising them.\n\nBecause you're not bogged down in routine implementation details, you can focus more attention on code quality, system design, and user experience. You can explore more alternatives because the cost of prototyping is lower.\n\nYou can also tackle more ambitious projects because you have a force multiplier for the routine parts of development.\n\nBut this only works if you maintain rigorous standards for the output. The moment you start accepting \"good enough\" code because it was faster to generate, you've fallen into the trap that gives vibe coding a bad reputation.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nVibe coding isn't about replacing human judgment with AI automation. It's about strategic collaboration where AI handles routine tasks and pattern generation while humans provide oversight, refinement, and architectural guidance.\n\nThe quality of your code depends on the quality of your review process, not the tool you use to generate it. Whether you're working with an LLM or a junior developer, the principles remain the same: clear requirements, thorough review, iterative improvement, and unwavering standards.\n\nThe developers who succeed with AI assistance are those who understand this distinction. They're not looking for a replacement for their skills. They're looking for a tool that amplifies their capabilities while maintaining their responsibility for the final product.\n\nThat's what vibe coding really is. And when done right, it produces better code, not worse.\n",

Great for preservation, but limited mobile integration. **Raindrop.io** offers visual bookmarking with cloud backup. **LinkAce** provides self-hosted monitoring with Internet Archive integration.\n\nLinks combines the best ideas while avoiding common pitfalls:\n\n- **File-based storage** (no database headaches)\n- **Self-hosted control** (your data, your rules)\n- **Actual content preservation** (not just pretty organization)\n- **Seamless mobile integration** (because that's where we live now)\n- **AI intelligence** (without the subscription fees)\n\nWhile others focus on tags, categories, and visual discovery, Links focuses on one thing: making sure your stuff doesn't disappear.\n\n## The Long-Term Vision\n\nDigital preservation shouldn't be complicated. Regular people need tools that work without constant maintenance. Links embraces this philosophy.\n\nIn an era where websites vanish overnight, Links provides a personal solution. No tags, no categories, no complex workflows. Just chronological organization that makes sense. And yet, everything is still just one full-text search away.\n\nYour data lives in human-readable files. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats. If you want to move elsewhere, everything exports cleanly.\n\nThis is digital preservation for the rest of us.\n\n## Ready to Use Today\n\nLinks is production-ready right now. All core features work reliably. The mobile integration is smooth. The AI summaries are helpful. The search actually finds things.\n\nAfter 115 commits of refinement, it's almost ready for prime time. I still need to bundle it up for distribution.\n\nUntil then, you can try Links at [links.alexanderkucera.de](https://links.alexanderkucera.de).\n\n---\n\n*Links is open source and self-hostable. Built with Kirby CMS, Python archiving scripts, and a healthy dose of frustration with disappearing content.*\n",

It&rsquo;s about having the tools to express my actual thoughts and ideas when my body isn&rsquo;t cooperating with my creative ambitions.</p>\n<p>The iterative process is crucial. I&rsquo;ll ask for revisions on specific paragraphs, request tone adjustments, or completely redirect sections that don&rsquo;t feel right. The AI is patient in ways human collaborators might not be - it doesn&rsquo;t get frustrated when I need the fifth version of the same paragraph.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-current-workflow\">My Current Workflow</h2>\n<p><strong>The Setup That Changed Everything</strong></p>\n<p>I built my writing process around TypingMind, which lets me create specialized agents with different skills. My &ldquo;Professional Blog Writer&rdquo; agent is like having a writing partner who actually knows me.</p>\n<p>The agent comes loaded with plugins that do the heavy lifting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perplexity Search for current research and facts</li>\n<li>Sequential Thinking for structured outlines</li>\n<li>Memoryplugin to remember my writing style and preferences</li>\n<li>TubePlus for YouTube content analysis</li>\n<li>Firecrawl for web scraping when I need specific sources</li>\n<li>Image Search for visual inspiration</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>From Idea to Published Post</strong></p>\n<p>My process is surprisingly simple now. I start with just a topic idea or maybe a short summary of what&rsquo;s bouncing around in my head. Nothing fancy.</p>\n<p>The AI immediately pulls up research, creates an outline, and we go back and forth until it feels right. Sometimes that&rsquo;s two exchanges. Sometimes it&rsquo;s ten. Depends on the complexity and how clear my initial thoughts were.</p>\n<p>Then comes the actual writing. Here&rsquo;s where the Memory Plugin really shines - it usually nails my writing style on the first or second attempt because it remembers how I like things phrased, my sentence patterns, even my weird quirks.</p>\n<p><strong>The Back-and-Forth Dance</strong></p>\n<p>When something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, I&rsquo;m specific: &ldquo;Make this section more conversational&rdquo; or &ldquo;This paragraph is too formal for my voice.&rdquo; The AI adjusts, and we keep refining until I hit that moment where I think, &ldquo;Yes, this sounds like me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The whole thing outputs in Markdown, so I just copy-paste into my blogging software. No reformatting headaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Why This Works for Me</strong></p>\n<p>The energy I used to burn on research and first drafts now goes into the creative refinement. I&rsquo;m collaborating rather than grinding. And because the AI learns my style over time, each post gets easier to perfect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h2>\n<p>The future of AI-assisted blogging isn&rsquo;t about replacing writers. It&rsquo;s about amplifying what they are already good at while compensating for their limitations - whether those are time, energy, health, or simply the occasional creative block.</p>\n<p>For bloggers dealing with similar challenges, my advice is simple: start small. Pick one aspect of your writing process that frustrates you most and see if AI can help with that specific piece. Don&rsquo;t try to revolutionize everything at once.</p>\n<p>The key is maintaining control. The AI is a tool, not a replacement. Your voice, your ideas, your standards - those don&rsquo;t change. What changes is having the support to express them even when life throws curveballs.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m more excited about blogging now than I&rsquo;ve been in years. Not because AI does the work for me, but because it helps me do the work I want to do, even when my body isn&rsquo;t fully cooperating.</p>\n<p>And honestly? That&rsquo;s made all the difference.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>This post was written with the assistance of Claude AI through TypingMind, following my usual collaborative process of research, outlining, drafting, and refinement until it properly captured my voice and experience.</em></p>\n",

It's about having the tools to express my actual thoughts and ideas when my body isn't cooperating with my creative ambitions.\n\nThe iterative process is crucial. I'll ask for revisions on specific paragraphs, request tone adjustments, or completely redirect sections that don't feel right. The AI is patient in ways human collaborators might not be - it doesn't get frustrated when I need the fifth version of the same paragraph.\n\n## My Current Workflow\n\n**The Setup That Changed Everything**\n\nI built my writing process around TypingMind, which lets me create specialized agents with different skills. My \"Professional Blog Writer\" agent is like having a writing partner who actually knows me.\n\nThe agent comes loaded with plugins that do the heavy lifting:\n- Perplexity Search for current research and facts\n- Sequential Thinking for structured outlines  \n- Memoryplugin to remember my writing style and preferences\n- TubePlus for YouTube content analysis\n- Firecrawl for web scraping when I need specific sources\n- Image Search for visual inspiration\n\n**From Idea to Published Post**\n\nMy process is surprisingly simple now. I start with just a topic idea or maybe a short summary of what's bouncing around in my head. Nothing fancy.\n\nThe AI immediately pulls up research, creates an outline, and we go back and forth until it feels right. Sometimes that's two exchanges. Sometimes it's ten. Depends on the complexity and how clear my initial thoughts were.\n\nThen comes the actual writing. Here's where the Memory Plugin really shines - it usually nails my writing style on the first or second attempt because it remembers how I like things phrased, my sentence patterns, even my weird quirks.\n\n**The Back-and-Forth Dance**\n\nWhen something doesn't feel right, I'm specific: \"Make this section more conversational\" or \"This paragraph is too formal for my voice.\" The AI adjusts, and we keep refining until I hit that moment where I think, \"Yes, this sounds like me.\"\n\nThe whole thing outputs in Markdown, so I just copy-paste into my blogging software. No reformatting headaches.\n\n**Why This Works for Me**\n\nThe energy I used to burn on research and first drafts now goes into the creative refinement. I'm collaborating rather than grinding. And because the AI learns my style over time, each post gets easier to perfect.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nThe future of AI-assisted blogging isn't about replacing writers. It's about amplifying what they are already good at while compensating for their limitations - whether those are time, energy, health, or simply the occasional creative block.\n\nFor bloggers dealing with similar challenges, my advice is simple: start small. Pick one aspect of your writing process that frustrates you most and see if AI can help with that specific piece. Don't try to revolutionize everything at once.\n\nThe key is maintaining control. The AI is a tool, not a replacement. Your voice, your ideas, your standards - those don't change. What changes is having the support to express them even when life throws curveballs.\n\nI'm more excited about blogging now than I've been in years. Not because AI does the work for me, but because it helps me do the work I want to do, even when my body isn't fully cooperating.\n\nAnd honestly? That's made all the difference.\n\n---\n\n*This post was written with the assistance of Claude AI through TypingMind, following my usual collaborative process of research, outlining, drafting, and refinement until it properly captured my voice and experience.*\n",

				"title": "My current posting workflow while on the go",
				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://parfene.com/\">Nick Parfene</a> over in the Indie Microblogging Slack asked me to write about my posting workflow and since I haven‚Äôt written about how I blog for <a href=\"http://blog.alexanderkucera.com/articles/blogging_workflow_again\">over three years</a> it could do with an update.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-change\">Why change?</h2>\n<p>First, why change the previous workflow? I got confused. Simple as that. My blogging schedule is erratic at best. And the old run and gun style workflow, while working, always left me scratching my head when I hadn‚Äôt touched it for a few months. I know, months is a sad amount of idle time between posts. But it is what it is.</p>\n<p>So to keep myself in the loop what happened to my blog I decided to adopt Git for keeping a publishing history. Not only does it allow me to tinker with the blog‚Äôs templates and CSS without messing up, it also serves as a nice automatic history what I did when and for what reason. I just need to read the commit log to job my memory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-in-between-workflow\">The in-between workflow</h2>\n<p>The last workflow I wrote about three years ago relied on a desktop machine running. While I have a server machine running 24/7 I did experience too many hiccups with that approach to feel reliable. So I switched it to a two pronged process that worked pretty well. On the go I was posting with Workflow and Transmit and on the desktop I was using Hazel with a <a href=\"https://alexanderkucera.com/uploads/2024/blog-post-transform.zip\">custom Python script</a>.</p>\n<p>This tended to work pretty well. Especially the on the go version. Write stuff in whatever text editor suits you best (I use <a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/de/app/ulysses/id950335311?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%253D4\">Ulysses</a>), send over to <a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?\">Workflow</a> for <a href=\"https://workflow.is/workflows/b0364be085534bb8b94003de824f8d4d\">processing</a> and upload to blog with <a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/transmit-ios/id917432930?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%253D4\">Transmit</a>. For images the procedure is similar only I use <a href=\"https://workflow.is/workflows/42d6d670bbd940148a8e3c945682bc15\">ImageOptim</a> or <a href=\"https://workflow.is/workflows/a70ddd60f996477385a2d5d2d934fa60\">Kraken</a> for image optimization before uploading. I use both at the moment and have not decided which one I like better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"microblog-and-git\">Micro.blog and Git</h2>\n<p>Now, beginning of this year <a href=\"http://www.manton.org\">Manton Reece</a> created a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing\">Kickstarter project</a> about Microblogging (Kickstarter is over, but you can enter your details on a <a href=\"http://riverfold.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=241a0ce5d267c19de7fcf819f&amp;id=98f8896de4\">mailing list</a> if you are interested in it). I found the idea enticing and so I joined the project. This basically got me fired up to tinker with my blog again, which led to the adoption of Git since I couldn‚Äôt make heads or tails of whatever my latest changes to it had been.</p>\n<p>The idea is really quite simple.

				"content_text": "[Nick Parfene](http://parfene.com/) over in the Indie Microblogging Slack asked me to write about my posting workflow and since I haven‚Äôt written about how I blog for [over three years](http://blog.alexanderkucera.com/articles/blogging_workflow_again) it could do with an update.\n\n## Why change?\nFirst, why change the previous workflow? I got confused. Simple as that. My blogging schedule is erratic at best. And the old run and gun style workflow, while working, always left me scratching my head when I hadn‚Äôt touched it for a few months. I know, months is a sad amount of idle time between posts. But it is what it is.\n\nSo to keep myself in the loop what happened to my blog I decided to adopt Git for keeping a publishing history. Not only does it allow me to tinker with the blog‚Äôs templates and CSS without messing up, it also serves as a nice automatic history what I did when and for what reason. I just need to read the commit log to job my memory.\n\n## The in-between workflow\nThe last workflow I wrote about three years ago relied on a desktop machine running. While I have a server machine running 24/7 I did experience too many hiccups with that approach to feel reliable. So I switched it to a two pronged process that worked pretty well. On the go I was posting with Workflow and Transmit and on the desktop I was using Hazel with a <a href=\"https://alexanderkucera.com/uploads/2024/blog-post-transform.zip\">custom Python script</a>. \n\nThis tended to work pretty well. Especially the on the go version. Write stuff in whatever text editor suits you best (I use [Ulysses](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/de/app/ulysses/id950335311?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%253D4)), send over to [Workflow](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?) for [processing](https://workflow.is/workflows/b0364be085534bb8b94003de824f8d4d) and upload to blog with [Transmit](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/transmit-ios/id917432930?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%253D4). For images the procedure is similar only I use [ImageOptim](https://workflow.is/workflows/42d6d670bbd940148a8e3c945682bc15) or [Kraken](https://workflow.is/workflows/a70ddd60f996477385a2d5d2d934fa60) for image optimization before uploading. I use both at the moment and have not decided which one I like better.\n\n## Micro.blog and Git\nNow, beginning of this year [Manton Reece](http://www.manton.org) created a [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing) about Microblogging (Kickstarter is over, but you can enter your details on a [mailing list](http://riverfold.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=241a0ce5d267c19de7fcf819f&id=98f8896de4) if you are interested in it). I found the idea enticing and so I joined the project. This basically got me fired up to tinker with my blog again, which led to the adoption of Git since I couldn‚Äôt make heads or tails of whatever my latest changes to it had been.\n\nThe idea is really quite simple. Git has the ability to run scripts, so called [Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), when certain events happen. In my case I use the [post-receive hook](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/githooks.html) to check out the newest version of my site whenever I push something to my server‚Äôs repository. There are a [number](http://bobbelderbos.com/2012/03/push-code-remote-web-server-git/) of [guides](http://toroid.org/git-website-howto) available, but the one I found most helpful was [Nicolas Gallagher‚Äôs](http://nicolasgallagher.com/simple-git-deployment-strategy-for-static-sites/).\n\nOnce that is set up the writing pipeline is really pretty similar to what I had above.\n\nWrite stuff in whatever text editor suits you best (I still use [Ulysses](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/de/app/ulysses/id950335311?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%253D4)), send over to [Workflow](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?) for [processing](https://workflow.is/workflows/1eb4469c83b145c8867311bdcb9cd986), which then sends the article to [Working Copy](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-enterprise/id965019520?mt=8), an iOS Git client. In Working Copy I can check and if necessary correct the post or snippet and then commit and push the changes to my Git repository on the server. There is gets immediately checked out to the live site. For images I still use [ImageOptim](https://workflow.is/workflows/42d6d670bbd940148a8e3c945682bc15) or [Kraken](https://workflow.is/workflows/a70ddd60f996477385a2d5d2d934fa60).\n\nThe desktop version is almost the same really. I also use [Ulysses](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/de/app/ulysses/id623795237?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%253D4) for my desktop writing.

Each category is in order of importance to my way of working. Well more or less. Halfway through I wasn&rsquo;t able to decide on the proper order, so higher up is generally more important to me, but it&rsquo;s a sliding scale the further down you get.</p>\n<h2 id=\"quick-links\">Quick Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#internet\">Internet Apps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#productivity\">Productivity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#media\">Media</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#shopping\">Shopping</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"internet\">Internet Apps</h2>\n<p>While Internet is a pretty broad term, I use it to designate apps that are used to interact with the online world.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/felix-iphone-edition/id562447652?mt=8\">Felix</a>\nWithout doubt still my favorite <a href=\"http://app.net\">App.net</a> client. It has gotten pretty slow on my iPhone 4, but I still keep coming back to it every day. Felix definitely is a top contender to the &ldquo;most used app&rdquo; spot.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunstroke/id488564806?mt=8\">Sunstroke</a>\nFor my news reading I am using a <a href=\"http://feedafever.com/\">Fever</a> install on my server. Sunstroke is without a doubt the best way to access my Fever feeds on the iPhone and I have tried pretty much every Fever compatible iPhone client out there. It is not as versatile as <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8\">Mr. Reader</a> on the iPad for sharing out items, but from a pure reading perspective I have yet to find a better app.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-5-for-twitter/id580311103?mt=8\">Twitteriffic</a></p>\n<p>I hardly use <a href=\"https://twitter.com\">Twitter</a> anymore these days. <a href=\"http://app.net\">App.net</a> has almost completely replaced the service with the bird for me. However, a lot of my colleagues still use it and I need a way to occasionally respond to DMs and mentions. Twitteriffic is a beautiful and more then adequate Twitter client for this job.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articles/id364881979?mt=8\">Articles</a></p>\n<p>For my <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a> research I prefer to use a dedicated client like Articles. This is one area where I grabbed the client that looked best for me way back when I got my first iPhone and I just never tried another one. So there might be better Wikipedia clients out there, but Articles suits me just fine.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dict.cc-dictionary/id327732352?mt=8\">dict.cc</a></p>\n<p>While my English is reasonably good, I do need to look up words once in a while. I found dict.cc a pretty good dictionary. Plus it is an offline dictionary, which is still something I rely on occasionally in spots with bad reception.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weatherpro/id294631159?mt=8\">WeatherPro</a></p>\n<p>I usually check the weather by looking out the window‚Äînow there&rsquo;s a revolutionary idea! But when I need to look up the weather at a travel destination or to check a forecast for the upcoming week WeatherPro has proven to be the most reliable app for Germany and Europe in general. And it has nice detailed statistical infos and weather radar imagery. Not that I could make heads or tails of those, but they look nice.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outbank/id585564091?mt=8\">Outbank</a></p>\n<p>For German bank accounts there is nothing better then Outbank. It is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and it actually works with a wide array of banks. While I don&rsquo;t check my accounts daily, Outbank is certainly the cornerstone of my own digital accounting and that of our business.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screens-vnc-access-your-computer/id655890150?mt=8\">Screens VNC</a></p>\n<p>Another one of these &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use often, but critical when I do&rdquo; apps. Screens allows me to quickly fix things on our server even when I am hundreds of kilometers away from home. Together with Screens Connect, its desktop counterpart, setup is a breeze and I don&rsquo;t have to trouble myself with ports and SSL, etc. It just works.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pushpin-for-pinboard/id548052590?mt=8\">Pushpin</a></p>\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://pinboard.in\">Pinboard</a> for everything bookmarking related, including keeping a downloadable archive of the bookmark, meaning if the page you bookmarked goes offline, you&rsquo;ll still be able to see the archived copy indefinitely.</p>\n<p>And a big feature for me is that I use Pinboard as Instapaper replacement. Pushpin is the client that helps me achieve that last part. Right now it is a basic way to browse my bookmarks and catch up on my unread items. However, there is a feature in the works that will make my goal of using Pinboard and Instapaper replacement complete: Offline reading. I don&rsquo;t know when exactly it is coming, but I was assured it is coming and when the day comes it will be glorious. Or so I hope‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8\">Dropbox</a>{#dropbox}</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t use the app that often, but it is very comforting to know that I have the option. Getting at anything in my Dropbox within a matter of seconds is truly convenient.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/facetime/\">FaceTime</a></p>\n<p>Skype can suck it. Especially since Microsoft took over and ruined the app even more. &lsquo;Nuff said.</p>\n<p>##Productivity {#productiviy}</p>\n<p>Productivity is such a loaded word that I try to avoid it. In this case I really am referring to apps that allow me to do work or to keep track of stuff.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8\">1Password</a></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to survive without 1Password. I&rsquo;d have to use the same password everywhere or juggle paper lists or something. Madness would ensue pretty quickly I am sure.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, AgileBits has me covered in the insanity department. 1Password is the first app I install on any machine. And since it syncs via Dropbox I can access my password library <a href=\"http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/1passwordanywhere.html\">even when I am on a random computer with Internet access</a>.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/begin-your-daily-to-do-list/id687455038?mt=8\">Begin</a></p>\n<p>Great little to do list app. Simple and very bare bones. Just what I need. I also have Omnifocus, but rarely use it. Begin I actually do use. It is a refreshing take on the old paradigm of creating lists to check off.</p>\n<p>###Mail.app</p>\n<p>What can I say? I rely on email and I find the default mail app to be very much sufficient. I have used Sparrow in the past, but with iOS 7 I switched back to the default app and haven&rsquo;t looked back.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8\">Drafts</a></p>\n<p>While I prefer to write on my iPad, I do use Drafts on the iPhone to sketch out quick ideas or as simple pasteboard. Sync with the Drafts for iPad app is instantaneous, so I can start a thought on my iPhone and continue it on my iPad in Drafts or <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8\">Editorial</a> without effort.</p>\n<p>I have set up a nice little array of custom actions in Drafts, which allows me to use it as a plain text journaling app or as a quick entry bucket for story ideas.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calendars-5-smart-calendar/id697927927?mt=8\">Calendars 5</a></p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/fantastical-2/id718043190?mt=8\">Fantastical</a> before Calendars, but as it turns out Calendars has the same natural language event creation, but a much nicer calendar interface. I don&rsquo;t use a calendar that often really, but it is always a pleasure to use Calendars 5 when I have to.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite-best-free-calculator/id300311831?mt=8\">PCcalc</a></p>\n<p>Powerful, quick, to the point. When I need to use a calculator this is the one I turn to. It allows me to be as simple or as complex in my calculations as I need to be and it can do so much more like convert units. Though for unit conversion I tend to use <a href=\"#vert\">Vert</a>.</p>\n<p>I linked to the free version above as that is already plenty powerful and if you so desire you can upgrade its functionality to suit your needs, which is exactly what I have done.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vert-2-unit-currency-converter/id691346630?mt=8\">Vert</a>{#vert}</p>\n<p>Vert is another one of those laser focused apps without any cruft, a concept that I seem to really gravitate to, don&rsquo;t I? Vert does exactly what it says on the tin. It converts a wide array of units and does so in a fast and efficient manner.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outliner/id284455726?mt=8\">CarbonFin Outliner</a></p>\n<p>Sometimes I need a list that is neither a todo list nor a full outline or mindmap. CarbonFin Outliner fills that niche nicely. It is very much alike the famous <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner\">OmniOutliner</a> condensed down for iPhone. It can be used as todo list app or as full blown outliner with comments and the likes. But it is clean enough that I can use it for my simple list making.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"http://www.navigon.com/portal/us/produkte/navigationssoftware/mobile_navigator_iphone_us.html\">Navigon</a></p>\n<p>The only turn by turn navigation I use. It is accurate, regularly updated with up to date map data and is generally nice to use.</p>\n<p>From the looks of it my global version of Navigon isn&rsquo;t offered any longer on the App Store. Instead there are several region based apps at a cheaper price.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/db-navigator/id343555245?mt=8\">DB Navigator</a></p>\n<p>The app of the German railway services. More of a nuisance then a must have, but it is better then juggling paper tickets.</p>\n<p>##Media {#media}</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-high-fidelity-podcasts/id723142770?mt=8\">Castro</a>\nThe new kid on the podcast client block has bedazzled me from the day it came out. Yes, it is very minimal in its feature set. However, I found that it actually offers all the features I need and not more. Before I was using <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/instacast-3/id577056377?mt=8\">Instacast</a> and lately <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8\">Downcast</a>, both great apps, but much too fiddly.</p>\n<p>I am so much happier with Castro and without feature bloat. Give it a try. You might like it.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audiobooks-from-audible/id379693831?mt=8\">Audible</a></p>\n<p>I cannot say enough good things about Audible. I love the way their service works. I love audiobooks. I love this app. That plus the fact that the support is simply awesome. Recently I found out that you can return two books a year within a year of purchase for a full refund without challenge from the staff. How awesome is that?</p>\n<p>I highly recommend a membership with them.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/naturespace-relax-meditate/id312618509?mt=8\">Naturespace</a></p>\n<p>Sometimes I need to switch off my brain completely or shut out the world. Naturespace is brilliant for that. It offers a great collection of high quality nature sounds that really transport you to the recorded location when you close your eyes.</p>\n<p>Listening to nature is a poor mans replacement to actually going outside, but it is worlds better then blasting my ears with music all day or using white noise to drown out environmental distractions.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera+/id329670577?mt=8\">Camera+</a></p>\n<p>My preferred quick and dirty image editor on the go. It has some nice filters and allows for some quick edits. And it allows me to share my pictures quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>There are other similar image editors like VSCO Cam (which I won&rsquo;t link to, because I despise it), but they all are too slow, ugly or have horrible filters in my opinion.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filterstorm-neue/id728479183?mt=8\">Filterstorm Neue</a></p>\n<p>Now this is a real work horse. Where Camera+ is my <em>Instagram</em> app, Filterstorm is my image editor on the go. It is pretty amazing what the developer has managed to pull of here. Quick, high quality editing on a tiny screen and excellent sharing options including direct FTP upload.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autostitch-panorama/id318944927?mt=8\">AutoStitch</a></p>\n<p>I do love panoramas. While the iOS panorama feature looks neat, my iPhone 4 is unable to use it. Also, I usually need more then a single horizontal strip of photos for my panoramas.</p>\n<p>AutoStitch is the best panorama app I have found. I can throw any amount of images at it snapped in all kinds of angles and it stitches them into a coherent panorama at a great quality and at up to 18 megapixels if I so desire.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camerasync/id406645727?mt=8\">CameraSync</a></p>\n<p>Once my images have been taken and edited, I upload them to <a href=\"#dropbox\">Dropbox</a>, my main storage location for all my pictures. CameraSync does so automatically in the background with a good selection of powerful options including the ability to prevent screenshots and videos from being uploaded if one so wishes.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unbound-for-dropbox/id586086921?mt=8\">Unbound</a></p>\n<p>After my images have uploaded with CameraSync I tend to delete them from my device. Unbound allows me to browse my complete image library from <a href=\"#dropbox\">Dropbox</a> in a nice interface.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-for/id406732590?mt=8\">Paprika</a></p>\n<p>A cooking app isn&rsquo;t exactly media, but it is the only category that semi-fit. Paprika is a great recipe app, because it is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and the recipes are synced between the devices. I can type in a new recipe when I am away for work and my wife can cook the dish at home a minute later or vice versa. Perfect.</p>\n<p>##Shopping {#shopping}</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-app/id297606951?mt=8\">Amazon</a></p>\n<p>I get <strong>everything</strong> from Amazon. The app is at the same time convenient and really not great to use. But it is better then the website at least from the iPhone, so I&rsquo;m using it.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kickstarter-for-iphone/id596961532?mt=8\">Kickstarter</a></p>\n<p>Hi. My name is Alex and I have a Kickstarter addiction.</p>\n<p>Seriously though, I love browsing <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com\">Kickstarter</a> projects in the app for awesome projects, while at the same time hoping that there won&rsquo;t be, so I don&rsquo;t feel compelled to throw money out the window.</p>\n<p>I really should delete this app‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/delivery-status-touch-package/id290986013?mt=8\">Delivery Status Touch</a></p>\n<p>The best way to track where my shipments are at. Fullstop. Again a service that syncs across iOS and OS X. Those are really the most versatile, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>Pew, that was quite the list. While I don&rsquo;t use everything on this list daily and these are by far not the only apps I have installed on my iPhone, I would consider this group of apps essential for my daily work and play. I hope there were some nuggets in there for you <a href=\"https://alpha.app.net/hashtags/teamappdiction\">#teamappdiction</a> people. :)</p>\n",

It is not as versatile as [Mr. Reader](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8) on the iPad for sharing out items, but from a pure reading perspective I have yet to find a better app.\n\n###[Twitteriffic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-5-for-twitter/id580311103?mt=8)\n\nI hardly use [Twitter](https://twitter.com) anymore these days. [App.net](http://app.net) has almost completely replaced the service with the bird for me. However, a lot of my colleagues still use it and I need a way to occasionally respond to DMs and mentions. Twitteriffic is a beautiful and more then adequate Twitter client for this job.\n\n###[Articles](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articles/id364881979?mt=8)\n\nFor my [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) research I prefer to use a dedicated client like Articles. This is one area where I grabbed the client that looked best for me way back when I got my first iPhone and I just never tried another one. So there might be better Wikipedia clients out there, but Articles suits me just fine.\n\n###[dict.cc](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dict.cc-dictionary/id327732352?mt=8)\n\nWhile my English is reasonably good, I do need to look up words once in a while. I found dict.cc a pretty good dictionary. Plus it is an offline dictionary, which is still something I rely on occasionally in spots with bad reception.\n\n###[WeatherPro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weatherpro/id294631159?mt=8)\n\nI usually check the weather by looking out the window‚Äînow there's a revolutionary idea! But when I need to look up the weather at a travel destination or to check a forecast for the upcoming week WeatherPro has proven to be the most reliable app for Germany and Europe in general. And it has nice detailed statistical infos and weather radar imagery. Not that I could make heads or tails of those, but they look nice.\n\n###[Outbank](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outbank/id585564091?mt=8)\n\nFor German bank accounts there is nothing better then Outbank. It is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and it actually works with a wide array of banks. While I don't check my accounts daily, Outbank is certainly the cornerstone of my own digital accounting and that of our business.\n\n###[Screens VNC](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screens-vnc-access-your-computer/id655890150?mt=8)\n\nAnother one of these \"don't use often, but critical when I do\" apps. Screens allows me to quickly fix things on our server even when I am hundreds of kilometers away from home. Together with Screens Connect, its desktop counterpart, setup is a breeze and I don't have to trouble myself with ports and SSL, etc. It just works.\n\n###[Pushpin](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pushpin-for-pinboard/id548052590?mt=8)\n\nI use [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) for everything bookmarking related, including keeping a downloadable archive of the bookmark, meaning if the page you bookmarked goes offline, you'll still be able to see the archived copy indefinitely.\n\nAnd a big feature for me is that I use Pinboard as Instapaper replacement. Pushpin is the client that helps me achieve that last part. Right now it is a basic way to browse my bookmarks and catch up on my unread items. However, there is a feature in the works that will make my goal of using Pinboard and Instapaper replacement complete: Offline reading. I don't know when exactly it is coming, but I was assured it is coming and when the day comes it will be glorious. Or so I hope‚Ä¶\n\n###[Dropbox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8){#dropbox}\n\nI don't use the app that often, but it is very comforting to know that I have the option. Getting at anything in my Dropbox within a matter of seconds is truly convenient.\n\n###[FaceTime](http://www.apple.com/ios/facetime/)\n\nSkype can suck it. Especially since Microsoft took over and ruined the app even more. 'Nuff said.\n\n##Productivity {#productiviy}\n\nProductivity is such a loaded word that I try to avoid it. In this case I really am referring to apps that allow me to do work or to keep track of stuff.\n\n###[1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8)\n\nI don't think I'd be able to survive without 1Password. I'd have to use the same password everywhere or juggle paper lists or something. Madness would ensue pretty quickly I am sure. \n\nThankfully, AgileBits has me covered in the insanity department. 1Password is the first app I install on any machine. And since it syncs via Dropbox I can access my password library [even when I am on a random computer with Internet access](http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/1passwordanywhere.html).\n\n###[Begin](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/begin-your-daily-to-do-list/id687455038?mt=8)\n\nGreat little to do list app. Simple and very bare bones. Just what I need. I also have Omnifocus, but rarely use it. Begin I actually do use. It is a refreshing take on the old paradigm of creating lists to check off.\n\n###Mail.app\n\nWhat can I say? I rely on email and I find the default mail app to be very much sufficient. I have used Sparrow in the past, but with iOS 7 I switched back to the default app and haven't looked back.\n\n###[Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8)\n\nWhile I prefer to write on my iPad, I do use Drafts on the iPhone to sketch out quick ideas or as simple pasteboard. Sync with the Drafts for iPad app is instantaneous, so I can start a thought on my iPhone and continue it on my iPad in Drafts or [Editorial](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8) without effort.\n\nI have set up a nice little array of custom actions in Drafts, which allows me to use it as a plain text journaling app or as a quick entry bucket for story ideas.\n\n###[Calendars 5](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calendars-5-smart-calendar/id697927927?mt=8)\n\nI used [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/app/fantastical-2/id718043190?mt=8) before Calendars, but as it turns out Calendars has the same natural language event creation, but a much nicer calendar interface. I don't use a calendar that often really, but it is always a pleasure to use Calendars 5 when I have to.\n\n###[PCcalc](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite-best-free-calculator/id300311831?mt=8)\n\nPowerful, quick, to the point. When I need to use a calculator this is the one I turn to. It allows me to be as simple or as complex in my calculations as I need to be and it can do so much more like convert units. Though for unit conversion I tend to use [Vert](#vert).\n\nI linked to the free version above as that is already plenty powerful and if you so desire you can upgrade its functionality to suit your needs, which is exactly what I have done.\n\n###[Vert](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vert-2-unit-currency-converter/id691346630?mt=8){#vert}\n\nVert is another one of those laser focused apps without any cruft, a concept that I seem to really gravitate to, don't I? Vert does exactly what it says on the tin. It converts a wide array of units and does so in a fast and efficient manner.\n\n###[CarbonFin Outliner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outliner/id284455726?mt=8)\n\nSometimes I need a list that is neither a todo list nor a full outline or mindmap. CarbonFin Outliner fills that niche nicely. It is very much alike the famous [OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner) condensed down for iPhone. It can be used as todo list app or as full blown outliner with comments and the likes. But it is clean enough that I can use it for my simple list making.\n\n###[Navigon](http://www.navigon.com/portal/us/produkte/navigationssoftware/mobile_navigator_iphone_us.html)\n\nThe only turn by turn navigation I use. It is accurate, regularly updated with up to date map data and is generally nice to use. \n\nFrom the looks of it my global version of Navigon isn't offered any longer on the App Store. Instead there are several region based apps at a cheaper price.\n\n###[DB Navigator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/db-navigator/id343555245?mt=8)\n\nThe app of the German railway services. More of a nuisance then a must have, but it is better then juggling paper tickets.\n\n##Media {#media}\n\n###[Castro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-high-fidelity-podcasts/id723142770?mt=8)\nThe new kid on the podcast client block has bedazzled me from the day it came out. Yes, it is very minimal in its feature set. However, I found that it actually offers all the features I need and not more. Before I was using [Instacast](https://itunes.apple.com/app/instacast-3/id577056377?mt=8) and lately [Downcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8), both great apps, but much too fiddly. \n\nI am so much happier with Castro and without feature bloat. Give it a try. You might like it.\n\n###[Audible](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audiobooks-from-audible/id379693831?mt=8)\n\nI cannot say enough good things about Audible. I love the way their service works. I love audiobooks. I love this app. That plus the fact that the support is simply awesome. Recently I found out that you can return two books a year within a year of purchase for a full refund without challenge from the staff. How awesome is that?\n\nI highly recommend a membership with them.\n\n###[Naturespace](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/naturespace-relax-meditate/id312618509?mt=8)\n\nSometimes I need to switch off my brain completely or shut out the world. Naturespace is brilliant for that. It offers a great collection of high quality nature sounds that really transport you to the recorded location when you close your eyes. \n\nListening to nature is a poor mans replacement to actually going outside, but it is worlds better then blasting my ears with music all day or using white noise to drown out environmental distractions.\n\n###[Camera+](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera+/id329670577?mt=8)\n\nMy preferred quick and dirty image editor on the go. It has some nice filters and allows for some quick edits. And it allows me to share my pictures quickly and painlessly.\n\nThere are other similar image editors like VSCO Cam (which I won't link to, because I despise it), but they all are too slow, ugly or have horrible filters in my opinion.\n\n###[Filterstorm Neue](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filterstorm-neue/id728479183?mt=8)\n\nNow this is a real work horse. Where Camera+ is my *Instagram* app, Filterstorm is my image editor on the go. It is pretty amazing what the developer has managed to pull of here. Quick, high quality editing on a tiny screen and excellent sharing options including direct FTP upload.\n\n###[AutoStitch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autostitch-panorama/id318944927?mt=8)\n\nI do love panoramas. While the iOS panorama feature looks neat, my iPhone 4 is unable to use it. Also, I usually need more then a single horizontal strip of photos for my panoramas. \n\nAutoStitch is the best panorama app I have found. I can throw any amount of images at it snapped in all kinds of angles and it stitches them into a coherent panorama at a great quality and at up to 18 megapixels if I so desire.\n\n###[CameraSync](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camerasync/id406645727?mt=8)\n\nOnce my images have been taken and edited, I upload them to [Dropbox](#dropbox), my main storage location for all my pictures. CameraSync does so automatically in the background with a good selection of powerful options including the ability to prevent screenshots and videos from being uploaded if one so wishes.\n\n###[Unbound](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unbound-for-dropbox/id586086921?mt=8)\n\nAfter my images have uploaded with CameraSync I tend to delete them from my device. Unbound allows me to browse my complete image library from [Dropbox](#dropbox) in a nice interface.\n\n###[Paprika](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-for/id406732590?mt=8)\n\nA cooking app isn't exactly media, but it is the only category that semi-fit. Paprika is a great recipe app, because it is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and the recipes are synced between the devices. I can type in a new recipe when I am away for work and my wife can cook the dish at home a minute later or vice versa. Perfect.\n\n##Shopping {#shopping}\n\n###[Amazon](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-app/id297606951?mt=8)\n\nI get **everything** from Amazon. The app is at the same time convenient and really not great to use. But it is better then the website at least from the iPhone, so I'm using it.\n\n###[Kickstarter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kickstarter-for-iphone/id596961532?mt=8)\n\nHi. My name is Alex and I have a Kickstarter addiction.\n\nSeriously though, I love browsing [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) projects in the app for awesome projects, while at the same time hoping that there won't be, so I don't feel compelled to throw money out the window.\n\nI really should delete this app‚Ä¶\n\n###[Delivery Status Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/delivery-status-touch-package/id290986013?mt=8)\n\nThe best way to track where my shipments are at. Fullstop. Again a service that syncs across iOS and OS X. Those are really the most versatile, aren't they?\n\n## Summary\n\nPew, that was quite the list. While I don't use everything on this list daily and these are by far not the only apps I have installed on my iPhone, I would consider this group of apps essential for my daily work and play. I hope there were some nuggets in there for you [#teamappdiction](https://alpha.app.net/hashtags/teamappdiction) people. :)\n",

Yes, Kirby is a little more involved and‚Äî <em>gasp</em> ‚Äîcosts money, but it is really flexible‚ÄîI built several sites with it for myself, friends and even customers‚Äî, fast and pretty cheap considering.</p>\n<p>Plus it works with text files and Markdown, both things that I value dearly and that make this specific workflow possible without a special &ldquo;<em>Kirby iOS app</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"drafts-optional\">Drafts (optional)</h3>\n<p><em>For completeness sake I&rsquo;m including my Drafts workflow as well. However, I have since completely switched over to Editorial for writing as well as post-processing my posts.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I started writing my posts in Agile Tortoise&rsquo;s Drafts, a fine and frictionless text editor with the added bonus that it supports the x-callback URL scheme and a ton of other ways to share or manipulate the written word.</p>\n<p>When I write a blog entry, I put the post&rsquo;s title in the first line and the actual post content right after it. If I want a subtitle, that goes at the very bottom with the tag <code>Subtitle:</code></p>\n<p>So a typical post in Drafts would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>This is my title\n\nAnd this is my content.\nIt can have any content.

It will also fill in a couple of things for me. Most notably the date and the title. So the above post transforms into:</p>\n<p>&lsquo;<code>This is my title.md</code>&rsquo; with the following content:</p>\n<pre><code>Title: This is my title\n\n----\n\nDate: 07.11.13 (used for display purposes)\n\n----\n\nTime: 2013-11-07-17-33-55 (used for sorting purposes)\n\n----\n\nAnd this is my content.\nIt can have any content.

Jump to the second part to see how I&rsquo;m working right now.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"the-old-way\">The <em>old</em> way</h4>\n<p>The next two steps are only for the times I want or need images in my posts or if I want to create one of those snazzy banners that are sorely underrepresented in my blog.</p>\n<p>I use Editorial as a simple text filter in this case. I could write something like this for Pythonista to make it work on iPhone (Editorial is iPad only), but I, well, I didn&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>\n<p>Editorial simply gives me back the future path of my new blog post, something I need if I want to drop pictures into that folder without hunting for the correct folder in my next step.</p>\n<p>I send over my post from Drafts to Editorial with a simple x-callback URL.</p>\n<p>You can import the URL Action into Drafts by clicking this link: <a href=\"drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=URL&amp;name=Copy%20Blog%20Path&amp;url=editorial%3A%2F%2F%3Fcommand%3D%7B%7Bcreate%20blog%20URL%7D%7D%26input%3D%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D\">‚Üí Import URL action &ldquo;Copy Blog Path&rdquo; into Drafts</a></p>\n<p>Editorial then cleans it up in a variety of ways. For example, everything gets turned to lowercase, spaces are removed, etc.</p>\n<p>The resulting URL is copied to the clipboard. In the example above <code>This is my title</code> turns into <code>http://alexanderkucera.com/20131108-this_is_my_title</code>.</p>\n<p>I opted not to run any action after this, as I want to be able to switch to any app I want as the situation requires. But usually it is now on to <em>Filterstorm</em>.</p>\n<p>If you want to import the URL cleanup workflow into Editorial or simply read through it in detail, you can take a look at this <a href=\"http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5035202761981952/hTzXZVeWcLI\">&ldquo;create blog URL&rdquo; Editorial Action</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"the-new-way\">The <em>new</em> way</h4>\n<p>Since I have completely switched over from Drafts to Editorial, I had to create a workflow that would prep a standard Markdown document and turn it into a blog post. Since Editorial is much more powerful then Drafts, I was also able to make it a bit smarter, ask for input on a few things and optionally archive or delete a post once I&rsquo;m done with it.</p>\n<p>It does a lot of things similar to my Drafts workflow though. After all is said and done, a file with the correct naming scheme gets written to a Dropbox folder. And I also get the blog URL at the end from the workflow above.</p>\n<p>The bonus with the Editorial workflow is that I don&rsquo;t need to watch out for any specific formatting. I can have a standard Markdown document and everything <em>just works‚Ñ¢</em>. And Editorial is just really pleasant to work in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5895905618165760/iEqPb0_XVkw\">Editorial Blog Posting Workflow</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"filterstorm-neue\">Filterstorm (Neue)</h3>\n<p>Filterstorm Neue, is brand new, but the old Filterstorm or Filterstorm Pro have pretty much the same abilities. Or you could use Photoforge 2 if you still have it. The important bit is that the app allows you to either <strong>export to Dropbox or to upload via FTP</strong> and to give your images <strong>a name of your choosing</strong>.</p>\n<p>Well, this step is really simple. Do your image edits. Done? Ok. Then upload it to the folder we just had the path created for in Editorial. Simple, right?</p>\n<p>Well, yes and no. There is one step that I consider crucial. I don&rsquo;t want to upload to my web server. I want to upload my image to Dropbox. I consider the Dropbox version of my site to be the canonical copy. Everything goes there first and then gets uploaded to the server. Otherwise I end up with a file mess. Files might get updated or changed here or there. Who knows? By always going Dropbox first, that issue gets sidestepped completely.</p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have an <em>always on</em> server machine, your best bet is to find a way to upload to Dropbox directly. Photoforge has a Dropbox uploading feature. Filterstorm does as well, though it involves browsing to your posts folder manually instead of just giving it a path.</p>\n<p>For various reasons, mostly because I don&rsquo;t want to hunt down a folder and I have the exact path I need from my Editorial workflow above, I decided to go a completely different route: FTP.</p>\n<p>I happen to use CrushFTP for work anyway, which means I just need to set up an FTP account that points to the blog&rsquo;s content folder in my server&rsquo;s Dropbox folder and the rest is very straightforward. Get path from Editorial and upload to said path.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hazel\">Hazel</h3>\n<p>The last and final step. The one step that unifies desktop and iOS blogging. Automatically uploading my posts from Dropbox to the server. Hazel is the perfect match for that. Especially since it got the ability to open an FTP connection on its own a couple of versions back.</p>\n<p>The Hazel flow goes like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look into the Drafts Or Editorial app folder and check if there is new post.</li>\n<li>Put the file into a subfolder called <code>&lt;date&gt;-postname</code>.</li>\n<li>Rename the file to <code>article.md</code> (the name of my Kirby layout template for a blog post)</li>\n<li>move the new folder with the post in it into my blog</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There another Hazel rule takes over as Hazel rules only ever can work on one folder at a time. It goes like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a folder? Look into it.</li>\n<li>Any file that doesn&rsquo;t have a red or grey color tag and that has been modified within the day gets uploaded</li>\n<li>After the upload color the file grey</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The color tags are there to stop Hazel from constantly uploading files that have been modified inside the &ldquo;today&rdquo; timeframe. But they also allow me to simply take off the color label if I want a file to be re-uploaded.</p>\n<p>Grab the Hazel ruleset here: <a href=\"https://alexanderkucera.com/uploads/2024/hazelrules.zip\">hazelrules.zip</a></p>\n<p>The one called <code>Drafts-Editorial-Folder</code> is for the incoming Drafts or Editorial file and the one called <code>Kirby-Blog-Folder</code> monitors the Kirby blog folder.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-it\">That&rsquo;s it.</h2>\n<p>See?

Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it.\n\t\n\t----\n\t\n\tSubtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle.\n\t\nYou can import this action into Drafts by clicking this link: [‚Üí Import Blog Posts action into Drafts](drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=dropbox&name=Blog%20Post&path=%2FApps%2FDrafts%2FKirby%2FBlog%2F&filenametype=1&filename=&ext=md&writetype=0&template=Title%3A%20%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0ADate%3A%20%5B%5Bdate%7C%25d.%25m.%25Y%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0ATime%3A%20%5B%5Btime%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0AText%3A%20%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D)\n\n### Editorial\n\n*This first part is part of the old Drafts workflow. Jump to the second part to see how I'm working right now.*\n\n---\n\n#### The *old* way\n\nThe next two steps are only for the times I want or need images in my posts or if I want to create one of those snazzy banners that are sorely underrepresented in my blog.\n\nI use Editorial as a simple text filter in this case. I could write something like this for Pythonista to make it work on iPhone (Editorial is iPad only), but I, well, I didn't feel like it.\n\nEditorial simply gives me back the future path of my new blog post, something I need if I want to drop pictures into that folder without hunting for the correct folder in my next step.\n\nI send over my post from Drafts to Editorial with a simple x-callback URL.\n\nYou can import the URL Action into Drafts by clicking this link: [‚Üí Import URL action \"Copy Blog Path\" into Drafts](drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=URL&name=Copy%20Blog%20Path&url=editorial%3A%2F%2F%3Fcommand%3D%7B%7Bcreate%20blog%20URL%7D%7D%26input%3D%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D)\n\nEditorial then cleans it up in a variety of ways. For example, everything gets turned to lowercase, spaces are removed, etc.\n\nThe resulting URL is copied to the clipboard. In the example above `This is my title` turns into `http://alexanderkucera.com/20131108-this_is_my_title`.\n\nI opted not to run any action after this, as I want to be able to switch to any app I want as the situation requires. But usually it is now on to *Filterstorm*.\n\nIf you want to import the URL cleanup workflow into Editorial or simply read through it in detail, you can take a look at this [\"create blog URL\" Editorial Action](http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5035202761981952/hTzXZVeWcLI)\n\n#### The *new* way\n\nSince I have completely switched over from Drafts to Editorial, I had to create a workflow that would prep a standard Markdown document and turn it into a blog post. Since Editorial is much more powerful then Drafts, I was also able to make it a bit smarter, ask for input on a few things and optionally archive or delete a post once I'm done with it. \n\nIt does a lot of things similar to my Drafts workflow though. After all is said and done, a file with the correct naming scheme gets written to a Dropbox folder. And I also get the blog URL at the end from the workflow above.\n\nThe bonus with the Editorial workflow is that I don't need to watch out for any specific formatting. I can have a standard Markdown document and everything *just works‚Ñ¢*. And Editorial is just really pleasant to work in. \n\n[Editorial Blog Posting Workflow](http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5895905618165760/iEqPb0_XVkw)\n\n### Filterstorm (Neue)\n\nFilterstorm Neue, is brand new, but the old Filterstorm or Filterstorm Pro have pretty much the same abilities. Or you could use Photoforge 2 if you still have it. The important bit is that the app allows you to either **export to Dropbox or to upload via FTP** and to give your images **a name of your choosing**.\n\nWell, this step is really simple. Do your image edits. Done? Ok. Then upload it to the folder we just had the path created for in Editorial. Simple, right?\n\nWell, yes and no. There is one step that I consider crucial. I don't want to upload to my web server. I want to upload my image to Dropbox. I consider the Dropbox version of my site to be the canonical copy. Everything goes there first and then gets uploaded to the server. Otherwise I end up with a file mess. Files might get updated or changed here or there. Who knows? By always going Dropbox first, that issue gets sidestepped completely.\n\nIf you don't have an *always on* server machine, your best bet is to find a way to upload to Dropbox directly. Photoforge has a Dropbox uploading feature. Filterstorm does as well, though it involves browsing to your posts folder manually instead of just giving it a path.\n\nFor various reasons, mostly because I don't want to hunt down a folder and I have the exact path I need from my Editorial workflow above, I decided to go a completely different route: FTP. \n\nI happen to use CrushFTP for work anyway, which means I just need to set up an FTP account that points to the blog's content folder in my server's Dropbox folder and the rest is very straightforward. Get path from Editorial and upload to said path.\n\n### Hazel\n\nThe last and final step. The one step that unifies desktop and iOS blogging. Automatically uploading my posts from Dropbox to the server. Hazel is the perfect match for that. Especially since it got the ability to open an FTP connection on its own a couple of versions back.\n\nThe Hazel flow goes like this:\n\n* Look into the Drafts Or Editorial app folder and check if there is new post.\n* Put the file into a subfolder called `<date>-postname`.\n* Rename the file to `article.md` (the name of my Kirby layout template for a blog post)\n* move the new folder with the post in it into my blog\n\nThere another Hazel rule takes over as Hazel rules only ever can work on one folder at a time. It goes like this:\n\n* Is there a folder? Look into it.\n* Any file that doesn't have a red or grey color tag and that has been modified within the day gets uploaded\n* After the upload color the file grey\n\nThe color tags are there to stop Hazel from constantly uploading files that have been modified inside the \"today\" timeframe. But they also allow me to simply take off the color label if I want a file to be re-uploaded.\n\nGrab the Hazel ruleset here: <a href=\"https://alexanderkucera.com/uploads/2024/hazelrules.zip\">hazelrules.zip</a>\n\nThe one called `Drafts-Editorial-Folder` is for the incoming Drafts or Editorial file and the one called `Kirby-Blog-Folder` monitors the Kirby blog folder.\n\n## That's it.\n\nSee? Simple, right?\n\n----\n\nSubtitle: Kirby, iOS, Drafts, Editorial, Filterstorm and Hazel tied into a neat bundle\n",

The water had to blend with the CG seamlessly. \n\n### Water Shading\n\n* custom, physically plausible water shader\n* a set of five different water noises to layer and mix the water as needed\n  * to avoid tiling a set of noise patterns was used to multiply the effects of the water noise parameters\n* once water was dialed in, it was **locked** and 3D artists couldn't change it and needed to adjust the scene to get the desired effect\n* and of course, physical accuracy went out the window as soon as we reach the comp stage or when the director wants the water different then the physical simulation says it should look\n\n### Skies\n\nAbout 140 different extremely high‚Äìres HDRi skies were shot and and artists could pick and choose crop outs\n\n### Meerkat Island\n\n* one giant single Banyan tree system with about 6 billion polys per frame\n* up to 45000 meerkats in one shot done with Massive\n* up to 10000 in the shot\n* basically only Pi is real, the island is CG\n\n### Richard Parker, the tiger\n\n* subsurface on the fur\n* new muscle system\n* not anthropomorphized at all\n* based on a real tiger, \"King\", from France, he appears in only 23 shots \n\nmuscles simulation ‚Üí subcutaneous skin layer ‚Üí epidermis layer that slides over the top ‚Üí covered by fur\n\nAll that leads to the realistic wiggling, bouncing and sliding of ski that makes for a realistic animal. \n\n10 million strands of hair lit with area lights, subsurface scattering\n\n----\n\nSubtitle: Talk by Chris Kenny, Compositing Supervisor, Rhythm & Hues\n",

We were actually starting to have some good old VFX fun. But not anymore. Now we have 20 people hunting for jobs again.\n\nIt really makes me sad to give up a great little company.

				"content_html": "<p>I don‚Äôt know if you already know this service called [Twitter] <a href=\"http://twitter.com/\">1</a>. It can be described as a IM independent status message, so you can notify people of your current doings if you like.</p>\n<p>[Coda Hale] <a href=\"http://blog.codahale.com/\">2</a> created a [Quicksilver action to post conveniently to Twitter] <a href=\"http://blog.codahale.com/2007/01/15/tweet-twitter-quicksilver/\">3</a>. [Ted Leung] <a href=\"http://www.sauria.com/blog/\">4</a> thought it would be nice to have [Growl notifications] <a href=\"http://www.sauria.com/blog/2007/01/18/growlified-tweet/\">5</a> in the mix and [Matt Matteson] <a href=\"http://dlzip.com/wordpress/\">6</a> thought it needed a bit more sparkle by [adding iChat support] <a href=\"http://dlzip.com/wordpress/2007/01/19/tweeter-twitter-quicksilver-ichat/\">7</a>. Well, now I add two more options to the mix.</p>\n<p>First I created a modified version of Mattesons‚Äô script to work with [Colloquy] <a href=\"http://colloquy.info/\">8</a> ‚Äî my favourite IRC chat client (Which I also use for IQC, MSN, Jabber and IRC via the help of [BitlBee] <a href=\"http://www.bitlbee.org/\">9</a>). This worked out pretty straightforward and nice ‚Äî and can be downloaded here (for setup instructions go to [Coda Hale‚Äôs page] <a href=\"http://blog.codahale.com/2007/01/15/tweet-twitter-quicksilver/\">3</a>). But then I thought it is stupid to have to change my status message of my chat client outside my chat client. So I sat down a little while longer and created a Colloquy script that posts to Twitter ‚Äî including Growl notifications.</p>\n<p>This script works like the normal <code>/me</code>¬ù commands in IRC but also posts the text behind the <code>/me</code> command to Twitter. Users of Colloquy should know what it does, but for you non-IRC people, <code>/me</code> creates an _action_¬ù message so <code>/me is hungry</code>¬ù becomes <em>AlexK (my nickname) is hungry</em>. And on [Twitter] <a href=\"http://twitter.com/\">1</a> it says _AlexK (my username there) is hungry_¬ù. It makes perfect sense (to me at least).</p>\n<p>###How to install</p>\n<p>To install it download this file, unpack it and save it as twitter.scpt into your Colloquy plugins folder (~/Library/Application Support/Colloquy/Plugins/twitter.scpt), then restart Colloquy (on some machines a system restart was necessary for unknown reasons).</p>\n<p>Then you need to configure it. If you‚Äôre not already using [Twitterrific] <a href=\"http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific/index.html\">10</a>, open Keychain Access and add a new password with the following data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keychain Item Name: <a href=\"http://twitter.com\">http://twitter.com</a></li>\n<li>Account Name: Your email address</li>\n<li>Password: Your Twitter password</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you‚Äôre already using Twitterrific, this password will already be in your Keychain. So just sit tight.</p>\n<p>Now you can use it with the commands <code>/tweet</code>¬ù or <code>/twitter</code>¬ù like so <code>/tweet is testing out this cool plugin</code>¬ù. It should send and action message to your current chatroom (Nickname is testing out this cool plugin) and also to your Twitter account (Username is testing out this cool plugin). After it succeeded you will get a Growl notification.</p>\n<p>On first use you will be asked if it is ok that the script gets access to your Keychain. This is fine and you should allow that. On first usage it might also take a little bit longer, but from then on it should run pretty fast. At least it does so over here.</p>\n<p>###Caveats</p>\n<p>I have one guy who had problems with it running very slow (up to 15 seconds), but over here is runs pretty much realtime. Of course it has to send data over the internet, so that might be a slowdown factor. I guess if you like just try it out.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> [Jesse Newland] <a href=\"http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/\">11</a> linked the slowness to AppleScript needing a lot of time to access the Keychain in some cases. Maybe a bug on Apple‚Äôs side? Anyway he suggest to [use Rubygems to work around this] <a href=\"http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/articles/2007/01/22/tweet-update-twitter-via-quicksilver\">12</a>. Thanks for that workaround, but I am not too hot on installing an extra piece of software just for this. But for all of you out there who have problems with my Colloquy/Twitter script being slow this might be a viable solution.</p>\n<p>And as always with this home-brewn scripts, I cannot give any guarantee that it works and I also distance myself from any damage done by it. It works great over here, but I cannot guarantee this for your setup. That is all I can say.</p>\n<p>###Following are comments from the old blog</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Blaine Says:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nice. It‚Äôs very cool to see twitter inching its way into every nook and cranny of the desktop and not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any particular reason you didn‚Äôt use Bitlbee‚Äôs Jabber integration to help you out?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alexander Kucera Says:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Well, two reasons Blaine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>I hardly use Jabber these days</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>When I use the Jabber route I am locked in to using Jabber</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let me explain the second one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let‚Äôs say I am in an IRC channel.

Well, now I add two more options to the mix.\n\n\nFirst I created a modified version of Mattesons‚Äô script to work with [Colloquy] [8] ‚Äî my favourite IRC chat client (Which I also use for IQC, MSN, Jabber and IRC via the help of [BitlBee] [9]). This worked out pretty straightforward and nice ‚Äî and can be downloaded here (for setup instructions go to [Coda Hale‚Äôs page] [3]). But then I thought it is stupid to have to change my status message of my chat client outside my chat client. So I sat down a little while longer and created a Colloquy script that posts to Twitter ‚Äî including Growl notifications.\n\nThis script works like the normal `/me`¬ù commands in IRC but also posts the text behind the `/me` command to Twitter. Users of Colloquy should know what it does, but for you non-IRC people, `/me` creates an _action_¬ù message so `/me is hungry`¬ù becomes _AlexK (my nickname) is hungry_. And on [Twitter] [1] it says _AlexK (my username there) is hungry_¬ù. It makes perfect sense (to me at least).\n\n###How to install\n\nTo install it download this file, unpack it and save it as twitter.scpt into your Colloquy plugins folder (~/Library/Application Support/Colloquy/Plugins/twitter.scpt), then restart Colloquy (on some machines a system restart was necessary for unknown reasons).\n\nThen you need to configure it. If you‚Äôre not already using [Twitterrific] [10], open Keychain Access and add a new password with the following data:\n\n* Keychain Item Name: http://twitter.com\n* Account Name: Your email address\n* Password: Your Twitter password\n\nIf you‚Äôre already using Twitterrific, this password will already be in your Keychain. So just sit tight.\n\nNow you can use it with the commands `/tweet`¬ù or `/twitter`¬ù like so `/tweet is testing out this cool plugin`¬ù. It should send and action message to your current chatroom (Nickname is testing out this cool plugin) and also to your Twitter account (Username is testing out this cool plugin). After it succeeded you will get a Growl notification.\n\nOn first use you will be asked if it is ok that the script gets access to your Keychain. This is fine and you should allow that. On first usage it might also take a little bit longer, but from then on it should run pretty fast. At least it does so over here.\n\n###Caveats\n\nI have one guy who had problems with it running very slow (up to 15 seconds), but over here is runs pretty much realtime. Of course it has to send data over the internet, so that might be a slowdown factor. I guess if you like just try it out.\n\n**UPDATE:** [Jesse Newland] [11] linked the slowness to AppleScript needing a lot of time to access the Keychain in some cases. Maybe a bug on Apple‚Äôs side? Anyway he suggest to [use Rubygems to work around this] [12]. Thanks for that workaround, but I am not too hot on installing an extra piece of software just for this. But for all of you out there who have problems with my Colloquy/Twitter script being slow this might be a viable solution.\n\nAnd as always with this home-brewn scripts, I cannot give any guarantee that it works and I also distance myself from any damage done by it. It works great over here, but I cannot guarantee this for your setup. That is all I can say.\n\n###Following are comments from the old blog\n\n>Blaine Says: \n\n>Nice. It‚Äôs very cool to see twitter inching its way into every nook and cranny of the desktop and not.\n\n>Any particular reason you didn‚Äôt use Bitlbee‚Äôs Jabber integration to help you out?\n\n---\n\n>Alexander Kucera Says: \n\n>Well, two reasons Blaine.\n\n>* I hardly use Jabber these days\n\n>* When I use the Jabber route I am locked in to using Jabber\n\n>Let me explain the second one.\n\n>Let‚Äôs say I am in an IRC channel. I‚Äôd have to switch the room to a Jabber connection to send my message to the twitter user.\n\n>With my script I am independent of the room I am in. It just intercepts the command and send it to Twitter. I don‚Äôt have to think about sending it to a specific user or anything else. I just type my command and it sends.\n\n>Very easy, very ‚Äúout of my way‚Äù. I like to keep it simple, otherwise I end up not using it.\n\n---\n\n>Rinoa Says: \n\n> Found you on digg. Have you considered having your script submitted on the Colloquy website?\n\n---\n\n>Alexander Kucera Says: \n\n>Hi Riona,\n\n>I wanted it to be tested by a few more people before making it an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù part of the Colloquy site. But yes, I am definitely thinking about submitting it.\n\n---\n\n>Blaine Says: \n\n>That makes sense. I didn‚Äôt realize Bitlbee was presented as an independent room in IRC.\n\n>Keep up the good work, and let us know (help@twitter.com) if there‚Äôs anything we can do to improve twitter!\n\n\n[1]: http://twitter.com/\n[2]: http://blog.codahale.com/\n[3]: http://blog.codahale.com/2007/01/15/tweet-twitter-quicksilver/\n[4]: http://www.sauria.com/blog/\n[5]: http://www.sauria.com/blog/2007/01/18/growlified-tweet/\n[6]: http://dlzip.com/wordpress/\n[7]: http://dlzip.com/wordpress/2007/01/19/tweeter-twitter-quicksilver-ichat/\n[8]: http://colloquy.info/\n[9]: http://www.bitlbee.org/\n[10]: http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific/index.html\n[11]: http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/\n[12]: http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/articles/2007/01/22/tweet-update-twitter-via-quicksilver\n",

So to avoid ugly constructs like version 2b5-new, we just stick to simple numbers 01, 02, 03 and so on. The recent version wasn‚Äôt good? No problem, make a new one and increase the version count.

That leaves you with room for up to 99 versions, enough for even the most error and revision prone projects.\n\n###Stick to your naming convention\n\nWell, this seems to be obvious, but it isn‚Äôt very easy, especially in a working environment that has no rules about files names. Co-workers don‚Äôt use it, so why should you? To stay on top of the chaos and to lead by example. Once your co-workers see how easy and efficient a working naming convention can be they hopefully will switch to it, too.\n\nI hope this was some useful info and if you wan to find out how we transfer this knowledge into a real life naming convention, then come back next week when I show you how I tend to use it.\n\nAlso please let me know what you think about this topic in the comments. Until then, take your work to the next level.\n\n[1]: http://www.lifehacker.com/software/file-management/ask-the-readers-filing-naming-conventions-210104.php\n[2]: http://www.43folders.com/2006/10/23/file-naming/\n",

I really did the same thing‚Ä¶ I think‚Ä¶ like it works just when it feels like, hehehe. yeah, I know, I know, it‚Äôs simply my fault - I don‚Äôt understand it  well but then another fact is that with RAT, and RfM as well, an insignificant little detail that you miss can result in complete disaster at rendertime. very sensitive. and I get nothing for free‚Ä¶ well, with RfM I do  RfM is much friendlier, so instead of tweaking things for days‚Ä¶ I only need hours  but errors seem to be inevitable. all the time.

However, Renderman wins this contest hands down, as it does displacements with virtually no extra overhead. The surfaces get subdivided into Micropolygons anyway, so the renderer already has the neccessary geometry for displacment.

If I didn‚Äôt know it better, I would not touch 3D Motion Blur either.</p>\n<p>###‚Ä¶and Instances\nRendering the Motion Blur scene without blur, a severe bug in the Pixar plugin is revealed.

Nothing special to report. Fast and nice.</p>\n<p>###Fur and soft shadows</p>\n<p>Well, this one I would say is a matter of personal taste. Renderman renders the fur best with DeepShadowMaps, which is like a shadow map, but with more bells and whistles. MentalRay doesn‚Äôt have DeepShadows and has to use Raytracing. That means, MentalRay shadows are always sharp and if you want them soft, you need more samples (=rendertime). The situation is the other way round with Renderman and DeepShadows. The default shadows look a bit blurry, but render fast and to increase the sharpness you have to increase the ShadowMap size and therefor increase rendertime.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a draw. If you like sharp shadows, go with MentalRay fur. If you like softer shadows (and I do, as real world shadows are never really sharp) go with Renderman.</p>\n<p>###Reflections</p>\n<p>Now we are entering the domain of MentalRay. It was built from the start as a Raytracing engine. And we can see that instantly in the rendertimes. Renderman however lived happily without Raytracing for ten years (or more) and has just recently (with version 11 I think) got the ability to trace rays.</p>\n<p>###Global Illumination</p>\n<p>Same here. MentalRay wins hands down. It feels right at home with tracing stuff.</p>\n<p>###‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Remember the Motion Blur advantage? Well, it is even more evident with Raytracing. MentalRay may rule with Raytracing, but it is unbelieveably slow with Motion Blur. And it gets rediculous with Raytracing/Global Illumination and Motion Blur at the same time.</p>\n<p>Renderman however, still slow, gets a big speed boost from lowering the quality in the blurred regions. Again fantastic!</p>\n<p>###Fazit</p>\n<p>So as a conclusion I would say, that both renderers have their areas where they shine and it would be a wise thing to know when to use which. All sympathies aside picking the best tool for the job. And if you do not need Motion Blur (or very subtle one that can be faked in post) go MentalRay, but for most other cases I would go Renderman any time.</p>\n<p>For a side by side comparison of rendered output and rendertimes please download the following PDF ‚Üí <a href=\"https://alexanderkucera.com/uploads/2024/rmanvsmr-forweb.pdf\">Renderman vs MentalRay comparison</a></p>\n",

The default shadows look a bit blurry, but render fast and to increase the sharpness you have to increase the ShadowMap size and therefor increase rendertime.\n\nI‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a draw. If you like sharp shadows, go with MentalRay fur. If you like softer shadows (and I do, as real world shadows are never really sharp) go with Renderman.\n\n###Reflections\n\nNow we are entering the domain of MentalRay. It was built from the start as a Raytracing engine. And we can see that instantly in the rendertimes. Renderman however lived happily without Raytracing for ten years (or more) and has just recently (with version 11 I think) got the ability to trace rays.\n\n###Global Illumination\n\nSame here. MentalRay wins hands down. It feels right at home with tracing stuff.\n\n###‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶\n\nRemember the Motion Blur advantage? Well, it is even more evident with Raytracing. MentalRay may rule with Raytracing, but it is unbelieveably slow with Motion Blur. And it gets rediculous with Raytracing/Global Illumination and Motion Blur at the same time.\n\nRenderman however, still slow, gets a big speed boost from lowering the quality in the blurred regions. Again fantastic!\n\n###Fazit\n\nSo as a conclusion I would say, that both renderers have their areas where they shine and it would be a wise thing to know when to use which. All sympathies aside picking the best tool for the job. And if you do not need Motion Blur (or very subtle one that can be faked in post) go MentalRay, but for most other cases I would go Renderman any time.\n\nFor a side by side comparison of rendered output and rendertimes please download the following PDF ‚Üí <a href=\"https://alexanderkucera.com/uploads/2024/rmanvsmr-forweb.pdf\">Renderman vs MentalRay comparison</a>\n",

Now these may vary depending on your tools, but at them moment our scene files substructure looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FinalCut</li>\n<li>DVD</li>\n<li>Maya</li>\n<li>Shake</li>\n<li>Combustion</li>\n<li>Compressor</li>\n<li>Other</li>\n<li>Temp</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you notice there is a temp folder just like in the main structure. These are supposed to be the brainstorm areas of the folder structure. Everything that goes in here is just dabbling and will not be backed up and the Temp folders will be deleted at the end of the project.</p>\n<p>Now depending on the tool you might want or need to go deeper with your folders. For example, Maya has its own project structure. You could use the default one in the above Maya directory or you could adjust it, so it takes advantage of the folder template we are just creating ‚Äî which would be a wise choice, because you don‚Äôt want to have several folders with the same meaning hanging around.</p>\n<p>####Materials</p>\n<p>Materials is everything coming in from the outside world. Graphics from the client, video clips, sound bytes, word documents and storyboards. All that goes in here.</p>\n<p>Again depending on your individual needs you may subdivide further into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Graphics</li>\n<li>Documents</li>\n<li>Fonts</li>\n<li>Subtitles</li>\n<li>Video</li>\n<li>Temp</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should be pretty clear what to use when, right?</p>\n<p>####Sound</p>\n<p>On most projects there will be sound involved. Music, sound effects, maybe speak. All that goes in here. Again within its own folder, like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Final Mix</li>\n<li>Speak</li>\n<li>Music</li>\n<li>Sound Effects</li>\n<li>DVD soundfiles</li>\n<li>Temp</li>\n</ul>\n<p>####Output</p>\n<p>Now this is our catchall folder for renderings. We render uncompressed material for archiving. We also render back and forth from editing to VFX. The DVD department needs to receive files, etc.</p>\n<p>A folder structure like this looks reasonable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uncompressed</li>\n<li>-&gt;VFX</li>\n<li>&lt;-VFX</li>\n<li>DVD</li>\n<li>Sound</li>\n<li>Temp</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first folder catches all the uncompressed output from editing. -&gt;VFX is all the stuff that goes into the VFX department and needs 3D or compositing effects applied. The VFX department then renders back to editing (&lt;-VFX) the finished effects.</p>\n<p>What the VFX department does when it has to render intermediate files you ask? That is a very good question. There are two ways to handle this in my opinion.</p>\n<p>The correct way would be to render all the layers and pre-comps into Output/-&gt;VFX because it is something that goes again into the VFX land. I also tend to create a 3Drenders and a 2Drenders folder, so I can split up the sub-folders and files. Otherwise it might get a bit too crowded.</p>\n<p>The lazy way would be to stay in the &lt;-VFX folder. That has the advantage of staying in one folder all the time. Which means human error can be minimized. It happens all too easily that you accidentally render in the wrong VFX folder. And if you have to switch between the two folder (-&gt;VFX and &lt;-VFX) all the time, then it might happen quite easily.</p>\n<p>DVD is obviously the folder where all the DVD files belong. All the m2v and m2a and vob‚Äôs and whatnot files only the DVD department can make use of.</p>\n<p>-&gt;Sound catches all the files that go to the sound editing as reference files.</p>\n<p>And Temp is the same as in all the other locations.</p>\n<p>####Approvals</p>\n<p>This is just a simple folder where all the files the customer needs to approve are saved. Preview clips and such.</p>\n<p>####Scratch</p>\n<p>This folder is similar to temp, but has a special meaning for the FinalCup folks. It is the folder where FinalCut renders all the internal caching and pre-render files.</p>\n<p>####Temp</p>\n<p>I said enough about the meaning of the Temp directories in the other paragraphs I think. As the name implies, the Temp folders are there for dabbling and trying things out. It will not be backed up and it also will be deleted at the end of the project.</p>\n<p>It is a sandbox, a playground to try things out.</p>\n<p>####That‚Äôs all folks</p>\n<p>That was a rundown on a basic production ready file and folder structure. Combine it with the naming convention I showed you and you have a nearly bullet proof system for all the basic needs of a production.</p>\n<p>And of course don‚Äôt be shy to adjust this template to your needs. This system lives from its ability to blend into the working environment. The idea is to make handling files in a project easy and fast, while minimizing the potential sources of human error.</p>\n<p>This is by no means the ultimate word on folder structures and if you have improvements to the above, I am all ears.</p>\n",

There are two ways to handle this in my opinion.\n\nThe correct way would be to render all the layers and pre-comps into Output/->VFX because it is something that goes again into the VFX land. I also tend to create a 3Drenders and a 2Drenders folder, so I can split up the sub-folders and files. Otherwise it might get a bit too crowded.\n\nThe lazy way would be to stay in the <-VFX folder. That has the advantage of staying in one folder all the time. Which means human error can be minimized. It happens all too easily that you accidentally render in the wrong VFX folder. And if you have to switch between the two folder (->VFX and <-VFX) all the time, then it might happen quite easily.\n\nDVD is obviously the folder where all the DVD files belong. All the m2v and m2a and vob‚Äôs and whatnot files only the DVD department can make use of.\n\n->Sound catches all the files that go to the sound editing as reference files.\n\nAnd Temp is the same as in all the other locations.\n\n####Approvals\n\nThis is just a simple folder where all the files the customer needs to approve are saved. Preview clips and such.\n\n####Scratch\n\nThis folder is similar to temp, but has a special meaning for the FinalCup folks. It is the folder where FinalCut renders all the internal caching and pre-render files.\n\n####Temp\n\nI said enough about the meaning of the Temp directories in the other paragraphs I think. As the name implies, the Temp folders are there for dabbling and trying things out. It will not be backed up and it also will be deleted at the end of the project.\n\nIt is a sandbox, a playground to try things out.\n\n####That‚Äôs all folks\n\nThat was a rundown on a basic production ready file and folder structure. Combine it with the naming convention I showed you and you have a nearly bullet proof system for all the basic needs of a production.\n\nAnd of course don‚Äôt be shy to adjust this template to your needs. This system lives from its ability to blend into the working environment. The idea is to make handling files in a project easy and fast, while minimizing the potential sources of human error.\n\nThis is by no means the ultimate word on folder structures and if you have improvements to the above, I am all ears.\n\n\n[1]: http://www.lifehacker.com/software/file-management/ask-the-readers-filing-naming-conventions-210104.php\n[2]: http://www.43folders.com/2006/10/23/file-naming/\n",
