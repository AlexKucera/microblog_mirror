This keeps me up to date on both local and global news and politics.</p>\n<p>For my tech news and other updates, I use <a href=\"https://feedbin.com/home\">Feedbin</a> to curate my feeds and <a href=\"https://voidstern.net/fiery-feeds\">Fiery Feeds</a> for reading them. Fiery Feeds has a few nice intelligent curation options, like Hot Links or Long and Short articles, that make it easy to catch up on too many RSS feeds every day. Yes, maybe I should subscribe to fewer feeds, but with Fiery Feeds, I really don’t have to.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overcast\">Overcast</h3>\n<p>Every couple of years, I switch podcast apps. I used to be an avid user of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/pocket-casts-podcast-player/id414834813\">Pocket Casts</a>, and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241\">Castro</a> was my favorite player for years. These days, I am back with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/overcast/id888422857\">Overcast</a>. I don’t have any special feelings for it; it works well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"youtube\">YouTube</h3>\n<p>Sadly, I am a sucker for YouTube videos. I do not browse the auto-suggestions much, but I have way too many subscriptions. At the moment, my „Watch Later“ queue contains 24 items, most of which are in the 20-30 minute range. However, there are a few videos that are 1.5-3 hours long that I haven’t gotten around to watching.</p>\n<h3 id=\"discord\">Discord</h3>\n<p>While I don’t engage much on Discord, I follow a few servers to get news announcements and participate in one or two in-person chats. The days when I was active daily for several hours on Slack and Discord are long gone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"health-related\">Health related</h2>\n<h3 id=\"macrofactor\">MacroFactor</h3>\n<p>I recently started using <a href=\"https://macrofactorapp.com/\">MacroFactor</a> to track my food and water intake. I have been on and off the food-tracking wagon in the past; usually, I track for a week or two before stopping again. The apps I have used in the past, like Lifesum and MyFitnessPal, are all nice and work reasonably well with tracking EU foods. However, they all miss a crucial element: they don’t adapt to one’s personal habits; they simply track food.</p>\n<p>MacroFactor, on the other hand, adapts to your eating habits, providing you with tailored goals and occasionally coaching you on what you can improve or change. It simply clicks with me much more than all the other apps I have tried.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rp-hypertrophy\">RP Hypertrophy</h3>\n<p>About a year ago, I finally accepted that I needed to build some strength to get my life back. Due to severe health-related issues, I pretty much stopped moving around 2016. I didn’t blow up, but I lost nearly all my muscle. Moving around the house became a chore at times. Combined with some serious joint inflammation, this kept me sedentary.</p>\n<p>No more. I started slowly to build muscle again. At first, I went too quickly, which resulted in weeks of not being able to work out due to inflamed joints. However, in combination with MacroFactor, I have been able to manage my food intake in a way that reduces inflammation while providing enough protein and energy to rebuild my strength.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://rpstrength.com/pages/hypertrophy-app\">RP Hypertrophy</a> app has been my steadfast companion. There are other exercise apps out there—some cheaper, some more expensive, and some even free—but none of them resonate with me like the RP Hypertrophy app does. The way it allows me to quickly set up a training plan is unparalleled. It also helps me with my progression by analyzing my workout volume. Great! One less thing to think about.</p>\n<p>RP Strength also has a <a href=\"https://rpstrength.com/pages/diet-coach-app\">Diet Coach</a> app, but for me, MacroFactor works better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writing\">Writing</h2>\n<h3 id=\"paper\">Paper</h3>\n<p>I recently stumbled across <a href=\"https://papereditor.app\">Paper</a> as a writing tool, and I really, really like it. I haven’t quite found the justification to pay for it yet. It comes with a hefty price tag in my region (the developer consciously charges more in richer regions of the world). However, I might consider it in the future, depending on whether I start writing professionally again in the coming months. For now, I’m going the cheapskate route and clicking away the nag screens that pop up now and again. Sorry, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_mihhail\">Mihhail</a>!</p>\n<h3 id=\"textastic\">Textastic</h3>\n<p>I don’t use <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/textastic-code-editor/id1049254261\">Textastic</a> for actual writing, but it is a great general text editor if I need to edit something from my iCloud, modify a file on my server, or whip up a quick Python script or other scripts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"airmail\">AirMail</h3>\n<p>My email client of choice is <a href=\"https://airmailapp.com\">AirMail</a>. There’s not much to say about it, really. It works for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"apps-by-readdle\">Apps by Readdle</h2>\n<p>I use several apps from the Ukrainian developer <a href=\"https://readdle.com/\">Readdle</a>. They tend to deliver a polished experience, and their support is excellent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"calendars\">Calendars</h3>\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://readdle.com/calendars\">calendar solution</a> is top-notch. It supports natural language event creation, the UI is nice, and it works better for me than the native Calendar app on iOS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scanner\">Scanner</h3>\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://readdle.com/scannerpro\">document scanner</a> works in a very no-nonsense way. It offers great support for de-skewing and straightening out your wonky document photos. It provides automatic OCR and document naming, and you can create workflows—something I haven’t taken advantage of yet, as my needs aren’t that complex.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pdf-expert\">PDF Expert</h3>\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://pdfexpert.com\">PDF reader</a> works great. You can edit and annotate PDFs. Sadly, there is no OCR on iOS or iPadOS yet, but I am told it’s coming.</p>\n<h2 id=\"strongbox\">Strongbox</h2>\n<p>I used to be a strong <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a> supporter. I bought it way back when I got my first iPhone—an iPhone 4. Since then, I have bought several updates, and when they switched to a subscription model, I purchased the family plan for—I think—two years.</p>\n<p>Then I read a thread on Micro.blog where someone talked about <a href=\"https://strongboxsafe.com/\">Strongbox</a>. I checked it out, installed it, and took advantage of their very generous three-month trial. After a week or so of use, they had won me over, and I happily paid for their lifetime license after the trial period was over.</p>\n<p>Granted, using Strongbox is a little bit more complicated and less streamlined than using 1Password, but their lifetime license costs what I used to pay for 1Password in a year. There is simply no comparison when it comes to value per euro.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ai\">AI</h2>\n<h3 id=\"perplexity\">Perplexity</h3>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai\">Perplexity</a> for searching most of the time instead of doing a Google or DuckDuckGo search. I enjoy getting nicely written summarized results, and if I want to dig deeper, I can simply open the sources Perplexity found for a given topic. I haven’t found any instances where the AI hallucinated an answer, but there have been a few occasions where the suggested follow-up questions were just nonsense.</p>\n<h3 id=\"typingmind\">TypingMind</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.typingmind.com\">TypingMind</a> is a great ChatGPT interface that allows me to use most ChatGPT  features without shelling out over $20 a month. It connects via the ChatGPT API, which results in much more reasonable costs. I got myself a premium license and haven’t looked back since.</p>\n<h3 id=\"midjourney\">MidJourney</h3>\n<p>Generative Imaging. Some people loathe it; I personally love it. <a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com\">MidJourney</a> is great for quickly generating dozens of variations on an idea, especially since they enabled generation via the website instead of in a Discord chat. We have used it to rapidly create initial drafts and, yes, even final designs for projects, both professional and private.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graphics\">Graphics</h2>\n<h3 id=\"affinity-designer-2\">Affinity Designer 2</h3>\n<p>Since I have mostly stepped back from work, we primarily focus on occasional graphic design for local projects, such as flyers, postcards, roll-up flags, and the like.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/designer/\">Affinity Designer</a> is unbeatable in terms of price and the value it offers for this purpose. Additionally, we can use it on the iPad for initial mockups and then continue working on the same file on the Mac. Brilliant!</p>\n<h3 id=\"affinity-photo-2\">Affinity Photo 2</h3>\n<p>It’s pixel-related brother, <a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/photo/\">Affinity Photo</a>, while not as intuitive and powerful as Photoshop, is still nevertheless our main go-to when it comes to editing images. Plus, it works well together with Designer and also offers the same iPad-to-Mac and back workflow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"qr-factory\">QR Factory</h3>\n<p>Since we switched to a more graphic design-based workflow, we regularly need to create QR codes. While there are many online and free generators available, <a href=\"https://www.tunabellysoftware.com/qrfactory/\">QR Factory</a> offers a comprehensive suite of QR options in one package. I wouldn’t consider using any other option anymore.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nuke\">Nuke</h3>\n<p>Foundry’s <a href=\"https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke-family\">Nuke</a> is my main workhorse for paid work. Although I don’t do as much as I once did, I am still very happy to pay for an Indie license when the occasional project comes in. Nuke remains the gold standard for compositing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"modo\">Modo</h3>\n<p>Similarly, when I need to do some 3D work, I use my trusty copy of Foundry’s <a href=\"https://www.foundry.com/products/modo\">modo</a>. It still gets me everywhere I need to go—though these days, that isn’t very far.</p>\n<h2 id=\"outbank\">Outbank</h2>\n<p>For banking in Germany, this is the way to go. <a href=\"https://outbankapp.com\">Outbank</a> has the best banking support of any app I’ve tried in the past. The developers had some negative press a couple of years ago related to pricing, subscriptions, and a completely revamped UI design, but I think they have recovered well from that.</p>\n<p>For my money, this is the best way to keep track of your money, at least for European/German users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"etsy-and-printful\">Etsy and Printful</h2>\n<p>I recently discovered <a href=\"www.printful.com/de/give-5-get-5/FO7BEA\">Printful</a>, and it got me interested enough to open our own little <a href=\"https://bdscribblewear.etsy.com\">Etsy store</a> with designs from the cutting room floor. I mean, why let perfectly good doodles and scribbles go to waste?“</p>\n<h2 id=\"it\">IT</h2>\n<h3 id=\"fe-file-explorer\">FE File Explorer</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.skyjos.com/fileexplorer/\">FE File Explorer</a> is my go-to app when the Files app on iOS won’t suffice. It is also a great FTP client and integrates nicely with our online workflow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shellfish\">ShellFish</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://secureshellfish.app\">ShellFish</a> is my preferred SSH client. I have tried a few others in the past, but ShellFish has really stuck with me. It also integrates nicely with Files.app.</p>\n",

Sorry, [Mihhail](https://twitter.com/_mihhail)!\n\n### Textastic\n\nI don’t use [Textastic](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/textastic-code-editor/id1049254261) for actual writing, but it is a great general text editor if I need to edit something from my iCloud, modify a file on my server, or whip up a quick Python script or other scripts. \n\n### AirMail\n\nMy email client of choice is [AirMail](https://airmailapp.com). There’s not much to say about it, really. It works for me.\n\n## Apps by Readdle\n\nI use several apps from the Ukrainian developer [Readdle](https://readdle.com/). They tend to deliver a polished experience, and their support is excellent.\n\n### Calendars\n\nTheir [calendar solution](https://readdle.com/calendars) is top-notch. It supports natural language event creation, the UI is nice, and it works better for me than the native Calendar app on iOS.\n\n### Scanner\n\nTheir [document scanner](https://readdle.com/scannerpro) works in a very no-nonsense way. It offers great support for de-skewing and straightening out your wonky document photos. It provides automatic OCR and document naming, and you can create workflows—something I haven’t taken advantage of yet, as my needs aren’t that complex.\n\n### PDF Expert\n\nTheir [PDF reader](https://pdfexpert.com) works great. You can edit and annotate PDFs. Sadly, there is no OCR on iOS or iPadOS yet, but I am told it’s coming.\n\n## Strongbox\n\nI used to be a strong [1Password](https://1password.com/) supporter. I bought it way back when I got my first iPhone—an iPhone 4. Since then, I have bought several updates, and when they switched to a subscription model, I purchased the family plan for—I think—two years.\n\nThen I read a thread on Micro.blog where someone talked about [Strongbox](https://strongboxsafe.com/). I checked it out, installed it, and took advantage of their very generous three-month trial. After a week or so of use, they had won me over, and I happily paid for their lifetime license after the trial period was over.\n\nGranted, using Strongbox is a little bit more complicated and less streamlined than using 1Password, but their lifetime license costs what I used to pay for 1Password in a year. There is simply no comparison when it comes to value per euro.\n\n## AI\n\n### Perplexity\n\nI use [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai) for searching most of the time instead of doing a Google or DuckDuckGo search. I enjoy getting nicely written summarized results, and if I want to dig deeper, I can simply open the sources Perplexity found for a given topic. I haven’t found any instances where the AI hallucinated an answer, but there have been a few occasions where the suggested follow-up questions were just nonsense.\n\n### TypingMind\n\n[TypingMind](https://www.typingmind.com) is a great ChatGPT interface that allows me to use most ChatGPT  features without shelling out over $20 a month. It connects via the ChatGPT API, which results in much more reasonable costs. I got myself a premium license and haven’t looked back since.\n\n### MidJourney\n\nGenerative Imaging. Some people loathe it; I personally love it. [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com) is great for quickly generating dozens of variations on an idea, especially since they enabled generation via the website instead of in a Discord chat. We have used it to rapidly create initial drafts and, yes, even final designs for projects, both professional and private.\n\n## Graphics\n\n### Affinity Designer 2\n\nSince I have mostly stepped back from work, we primarily focus on occasional graphic design for local projects, such as flyers, postcards, roll-up flags, and the like.\n\n[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/) is unbeatable in terms of price and the value it offers for this purpose. Additionally, we can use it on the iPad for initial mockups and then continue working on the same file on the Mac. Brilliant!\n\n### Affinity Photo 2\n\nIt’s pixel-related brother, [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/photo/), while not as intuitive and powerful as Photoshop, is still nevertheless our main go-to when it comes to editing images. Plus, it works well together with Designer and also offers the same iPad-to-Mac and back workflow.\n\n### QR Factory\n\nSince we switched to a more graphic design-based workflow, we regularly need to create QR codes. While there are many online and free generators available, [QR Factory](https://www.tunabellysoftware.com/qrfactory/) offers a comprehensive suite of QR options in one package. I wouldn’t consider using any other option anymore.\n\n### Nuke\n\nFoundry’s [Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke-family) is my main workhorse for paid work. Although I don’t do as much as I once did, I am still very happy to pay for an Indie license when the occasional project comes in. Nuke remains the gold standard for compositing.\n\n### Modo\n\nSimilarly, when I need to do some 3D work, I use my trusty copy of Foundry’s [modo](https://www.foundry.com/products/modo). It still gets me everywhere I need to go—though these days, that isn’t very far.\n\n## Outbank\n\nFor banking in Germany, this is the way to go. [Outbank](https://outbankapp.com) has the best banking support of any app I’ve tried in the past. The developers had some negative press a couple of years ago related to pricing, subscriptions, and a completely revamped UI design, but I think they have recovered well from that.\n\nFor my money, this is the best way to keep track of your money, at least for European/German users.\n\n## Etsy and Printful\n\nI recently discovered [Printful](www.printful.com/de/give-5-get-5/FO7BEA), and it got me interested enough to open our own little [Etsy store](https://bdscribblewear.etsy.com) with designs from the cutting room floor. I mean, why let perfectly good doodles and scribbles go to waste?“\n\n## IT\n\n### FE File Explorer\n\n[FE File Explorer](https://www.skyjos.com/fileexplorer/) is my go-to app when the Files app on iOS won’t suffice. It is also a great FTP client and integrates nicely with our online workflow.\n\n### ShellFish\n\n[ShellFish](https://secureshellfish.app) is my preferred SSH client. I have tried a few others in the past, but ShellFish has really stuck with me. It also integrates nicely with Files.app.\n",

Each category is in order of importance to my way of working. Well more or less.

It has gotten pretty slow on my iPhone 4, but I still keep coming back to it every day. Felix definitely is a top contender to the &ldquo;most used app&rdquo; spot.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunstroke/id488564806?mt=8\">Sunstroke</a>\nFor my news reading I am using a <a href=\"http://feedafever.com/\">Fever</a> install on my server. Sunstroke is without a doubt the best way to access my Fever feeds on the iPhone and I have tried pretty much every Fever compatible iPhone client out there. It is not as versatile as <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8\">Mr. Reader</a> on the iPad for sharing out items, but from a pure reading perspective I have yet to find a better app.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-5-for-twitter/id580311103?mt=8\">Twitteriffic</a></p>\n<p>I hardly use <a href=\"https://twitter.com\">Twitter</a> anymore these days. <a href=\"http://app.net\">App.net</a> has almost completely replaced the service with the bird for me. However, a lot of my colleagues still use it and I need a way to occasionally respond to DMs and mentions. Twitteriffic is a beautiful and more then adequate Twitter client for this job.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articles/id364881979?mt=8\">Articles</a></p>\n<p>For my <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a> research I prefer to use a dedicated client like Articles. This is one area where I grabbed the client that looked best for me way back when I got my first iPhone and I just never tried another one. So there might be better Wikipedia clients out there, but Articles suits me just fine.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dict.cc-dictionary/id327732352?mt=8\">dict.cc</a></p>\n<p>While my English is reasonably good, I do need to look up words once in a while. I found dict.cc a pretty good dictionary. Plus it is an offline dictionary, which is still something I rely on occasionally in spots with bad reception.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weatherpro/id294631159?mt=8\">WeatherPro</a></p>\n<p>I usually check the weather by looking out the window—now there&rsquo;s a revolutionary idea! But when I need to look up the weather at a travel destination or to check a forecast for the upcoming week WeatherPro has proven to be the most reliable app for Germany and Europe in general.

Pushpin is the client that helps me achieve that last part. Right now it is a basic way to browse my bookmarks and catch up on my unread items. However, there is a feature in the works that will make my goal of using Pinboard and Instapaper replacement complete: Offline reading.

				"content_text": "\nIn the spirit of app recommendation lists that keep popping up everywhere I decided to make my own. I do have a lot of iOS apps. In fact, I went a little overboard in 2012 and the first half of 2013. So much so that after I added up the amount of money I spent on app purchases, I went on a very strict app feast for the rest of 2013.\n\nAnyway, my point is that I have tried a lot of apps and a couple stuck leading to the top apps I use today. Each category is in order of importance to my way of working. Well more or less. Halfway through I wasn't able to decide on the proper order, so higher up is generally more important to me, but it's a sliding scale the further down you get.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n* [Internet Apps](#internet)\n* [Productivity](#productivity)\n* [Media](#media)\n* [Shopping](#shopping)\n\n## Internet Apps {#internet}\nWhile Internet is a pretty broad term, I use it to designate apps that are used to interact with the online world.\n\n###[Felix](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/felix-iphone-edition/id562447652?mt=8)\nWithout doubt still my favorite [App.net](http://app.net) client. It has gotten pretty slow on my iPhone 4, but I still keep coming back to it every day. Felix definitely is a top contender to the \"most used app\" spot.\n\n###[Sunstroke](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunstroke/id488564806?mt=8)\nFor my news reading I am using a [Fever](http://feedafever.com/) install on my server. Sunstroke is without a doubt the best way to access my Fever feeds on the iPhone and I have tried pretty much every Fever compatible iPhone client out there. It is not as versatile as [Mr. Reader](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8) on the iPad for sharing out items, but from a pure reading perspective I have yet to find a better app.\n\n###[Twitteriffic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-5-for-twitter/id580311103?mt=8)\n\nI hardly use [Twitter](https://twitter.com) anymore these days. [App.net](http://app.net) has almost completely replaced the service with the bird for me. However, a lot of my colleagues still use it and I need a way to occasionally respond to DMs and mentions. Twitteriffic is a beautiful and more then adequate Twitter client for this job.\n\n###[Articles](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articles/id364881979?mt=8)\n\nFor my [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) research I prefer to use a dedicated client like Articles. This is one area where I grabbed the client that looked best for me way back when I got my first iPhone and I just never tried another one. So there might be better Wikipedia clients out there, but Articles suits me just fine.\n\n###[dict.cc](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dict.cc-dictionary/id327732352?mt=8)\n\nWhile my English is reasonably good, I do need to look up words once in a while.

Plus it is an offline dictionary, which is still something I rely on occasionally in spots with bad reception.\n\n###[WeatherPro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weatherpro/id294631159?mt=8)\n\nI usually check the weather by looking out the window—now there's a revolutionary idea!

But it is better then the website at least from the iPhone, so I'm using it.\n\n###[Kickstarter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kickstarter-for-iphone/id596961532?mt=8)\n\nHi. My name is Alex and I have a Kickstarter addiction.\n\nSeriously though, I love browsing [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) projects in the app for awesome projects, while at the same time hoping that there won't be, so I don't feel compelled to throw money out the window.\n\nI really should delete this app…\n\n###[Delivery Status Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/delivery-status-touch-package/id290986013?mt=8)\n\nThe best way to track where my shipments are at. Fullstop. Again a service that syncs across iOS and OS X. Those are really the most versatile, aren't they?\n\n## Summary\n\nPew, that was quite the list. While I don't use everything on this list daily and these are by far not the only apps I have installed on my iPhone, I would consider this group of apps essential for my daily work and play. I hope there were some nuggets in there for you [#teamappdiction](https://alpha.app.net/hashtags/teamappdiction) people. :)\n",

				"title": "Blogging Workflow…again",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Yes, I finally am blogging again. Only 6 months of silence this time. Not too shabby.</p>\n<p>Anyway, a major hindrance was that my blogging workflow wasn&rsquo;t working quite right yet, which in turn was like an invisible wall that I was just too tired to climb each time I want to post something. Luckily, I have had the last two days to tinker with it and to figure it out. Now I have a pretty solid workflow. Well, at the moment it looks solid. It is not battle tested however. That&rsquo;s what future blog posts are for.</p>\n<p>But since it is a little involved, I thought I&rsquo;d write it down here right away. For one so I won&rsquo;t forget and also some friends asked me how I am handling blogging from iOS to my <a href=\"http://getkirby.com\">Kirby</a> blog.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tldr1\">Tl;dr<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></h2>\n<p>Write your post in whatever text editor you prefer. Ideally one that supports x-callbacks. I personally use Editorial since it&rsquo;s nice for writing and I also use it for processing everything anyway. Before that I used Drafts together with Editorial.</p>\n<p>Fire off the Editorial workflow that transforms your text into a blog post with the correct formatting and uploads it to Dropbox.</p>\n<p>Create or edit any imagery that goes along with the post and upload the images to the right Dropbox folder. The path of said folder has been copied to the clipboard by the above Editorial workflow.</p>\n<p>Have Hazel put everything into place and let it upload to post to the web server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-long-version\">The long version</h2>\n<p>There are several steps involved to make this work. It sounds complicated, but is actually rather straightforward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://getkirby.com\">Kirby</a>, of course.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/\">Drafts</a> (or any other editor that allows you to send stuff to Editorial via <a href=\"http://x-callback-url.com/\">x-callback URLs</a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://omz-software.com/editorial/\">Editorial</a>, <a href=\"http://omz-software.com/pythonista/index.html\">Pythonista</a> works equally well, but Editorial is simpler to set up, plus you can write in Editorial as well and just skip <em>Drafts</em> entirely, which is what I do most of the time.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://filterstormneue.com\">Filterstorm Neue</a> or alternatively Photoforge 2 if you still have access to it.</li>\n<li>Dropbox</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.noodlesoft.com\">Hazel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.crushftp.com\">CrushFTP</a>, optional, but depending on the image editor you use more convenient</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"kirby\">Kirby</h3>\n<p>First of all, why Kirby? Sounds like an awful lot of work for something that Tumblr offers for free. Tumblr even has an iOS app. Just log in and be done with it.</p>\n<p>For me it comes down to owning what I create. And that involves hosting  what I create. Yes, Kirby is a little more involved and— <em>gasp</em> —costs money, but it is really flexible—I built several sites with it for myself, friends and even customers—, fast and pretty cheap considering.</p>\n<p>Plus it works with text files and Markdown, both things that I value dearly and that make this specific workflow possible without a special &ldquo;<em>Kirby iOS app</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"drafts-optional\">Drafts (optional)</h3>\n<p><em>For completeness sake I&rsquo;m including my Drafts workflow as well.

Not too shabby.\n\nAnyway, a major hindrance was that my blogging workflow wasn't working quite right yet, which in turn was like an invisible wall that I was just too tired to climb each time I want to post something. Luckily, I have had the last two days to tinker with it and to figure it out. Now I have a pretty solid workflow. Well, at the moment it looks solid. It is not battle tested however. That's what future blog posts are for.\n\nBut since it is a little involved, I thought I'd write it down here right away. For one so I won't forget and also some friends asked me how I am handling blogging from iOS to my [Kirby](http://getkirby.com) blog.\n\n## Tl;dr[^1]\n\n[^1]: [Too long; Didn't read](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr)\n\nWrite your post in whatever text editor you prefer. Ideally one that supports x-callbacks. I personally use Editorial since it's nice for writing and I also use it for processing everything anyway. Before that I used Drafts together with Editorial.\n\nFire off the Editorial workflow that transforms your text into a blog post with the correct formatting and uploads it to Dropbox. \n\nCreate or edit any imagery that goes along with the post and upload the images to the right Dropbox folder. The path of said folder has been copied to the clipboard by the above Editorial workflow. \n\nHave Hazel put everything into place and let it upload to post to the web server. \n\n## The long version\n\nThere are several steps involved to make this work. It sounds complicated, but is actually rather straightforward.\n\n* [Kirby](http://getkirby.com), of course.\n* [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/) (or any other editor that allows you to send stuff to Editorial via [x-callback URLs](http://x-callback-url.com/)).\n* [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/), [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/index.html) works equally well, but Editorial is simpler to set up, plus you can write in Editorial as well and just skip *Drafts* entirely, which is what I do most of the time.\n* [Filterstorm Neue](http://filterstormneue.com) or alternatively Photoforge 2 if you still have access to it.\n* Dropbox\n* [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com)\n* [CrushFTP](http://www.crushftp.com), optional, but depending on the image editor you use more convenient\n\n### Kirby\n\nFirst of all, why Kirby? Sounds like an awful lot of work for something that Tumblr offers for free. Tumblr even has an iOS app. Just log in and be done with it.\n\nFor me it comes down to owning what I create. And that involves hosting  what I create. Yes, Kirby is a little more involved and— *gasp* —costs money, but it is really flexible—I built several sites with it for myself, friends and even customers—, fast and pretty cheap considering.\n\nPlus it works with text files and Markdown, both things that I value dearly and that make this specific workflow possible without a special \"*Kirby iOS app*\".\n\n### Drafts (optional)\n\n*For completeness sake I'm including my Drafts workflow as well. However, I have since completely switched over to Editorial for writing as well as post-processing my posts.*\n\n---\n\nI started writing my posts in Agile Tortoise's Drafts, a fine and frictionless text editor with the added bonus that it supports the x-callback URL scheme and a ton of other ways to share or manipulate the written word.\n\nWhen I write a blog entry, I put the post's title in the first line and the actual post content right after it. If I want a subtitle, that goes at the very bottom with the tag `Subtitle:`\n\nSo a typical post in Drafts would look like this:\n\n\t\n\tThis is my title\n\t\n\tAnd this is my content.\n\tIt can have any content. Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it.\n\t\n\t----\n\t\n\tSubtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle.\n\nWhen it comes time to share my post with the world, I have a Dropbox action called *Blog Post*, that will create a file in a designated Dropbox folder—I have a global *Apps* folder and I put it in a subfolder there—with the name of my post title as filename. It will also fill in a couple of things for me. Most notably the date and the title. So the above post transforms into:\n\n'`This is my title.md`' with the following content:\n\n\tTitle: This is my title\n\t\n\t----\n\n\tDate: 07.11.13 (used for display purposes)\n\n\t----\n\n\tTime: 2013-11-07-17-33-55 (used for sorting purposes)\n\n\t----\n\t\n\tAnd this is my content.\n\tIt can have any content.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I don&rsquo;t have my own camera kit specifically for VFX yet. Usually when I am on set, I either rent or get equipment from the production that is hiring me. Now I am about to build my own camera kit and to stay halfway reasonable I want to stay around €6000, though I can go over that amount to get a better kit if need be. And it looks like I might have to.</p>\n<p>I thought I&rsquo;d ask you guys for opinions on what to get and if I maybe can switch around a few things to get the most bang for my buck. Also, writing it all down is more for my benefit really, as it allows me to think through things better.</p>\n<p>The goal is to build a kit that works well in four different situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professional:\n<ul>\n<li>Set photography (making reference photos, shooting textures, making set HDRis, etc.)</li>\n<li>Panorama photography (HDRi and normal panoramas)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Personal:\n<ul>\n<li>Since I am a rather new dad (boy, 10 months) I will use the camera for child photography. He is already a speedy little guy and I only see this getting more intense as time moves on.</li>\n<li>Also, we own three ferrets who are even speedier.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So all things considered, I am looking to build a kit that serves well for kid and animal photography as well as on set photography.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-list\">The List</h2>\n<p>So far my list looks like this (all prices are not yet researched for cheapness but mostly straight off of Amazon):</p>\n<h3 id=\"cameras\">Cameras:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Canon 7D ~€1200</li>\n<li>Canon 5D Mark III ~€2600</li>\n<li>Canon 5D Mark II ~€2300</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am itching for the full frame sensor. Getting the older MK2 doesn&rsquo;t seem to make much sense as it was still rather expensive when I looked.</p>\n<p>The 7D I am unsure about. Yes, it is cheaper, but also not a full frame sensor. However, I could use the saved money to get more/better glass.</p>\n<p>Another added benefit of the less then full frame sensor is that is allows me to capture a higher resolution panorama with the 8mm Sigma at the cost of needing one or two more shots to get a full 360° panorama. So higher res, but slower workflow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lenses\">Lenses:</h3>\n<p>The options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sigma 8mm Fisheye ~€750</li>\n<li>Canon 50mm F1.2 (~€1400) or F1.4 (~€300)</li>\n<li>Canon 70-200mm f2,8 ~€1000 (without image stabilization) or -2000 (with image stabilization)</li>\n<li>Canon 70-200mm ~€1000 (or I go f4 with image stabilization)</li>\n<li>Canon 20mm f2.8 ~€450</li>\n<li>Canon EF 16-35mm 1:2,8L II USM ~€1300</li>\n<li>Sigma 35 mm f/1,4 DG HSM ~€800</li>\n<li>Canon EF 35mm 1:1,4 L USM ~€1300</li>\n<li>Canon 24-70mm f2.8 ~€2000</li>\n<li>Canon Extender EF 2x III ~€480</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am only sure about the 8mm Sigma and pretty sure I want to get a 70-200mm, but inbetween I am torn. Get a 50mm prime or a 24-70mm zoom? Maybe a 35mm? 85mm?</p>\n<p>I do like the added quality and speed of a prime lens. For my main use case, which will be professional panorama photography, I think I&rsquo;m going to go 8mm (standard, quick on-set pano HDR), 20mm (high-res on-set HDR pano) and 50mm (for those gigapanos and child photography).</p>\n<p>The 70-200mm will be used for capturing textures and general on-set photography. Still not sure if I want the added quality of the f2.8 or if the f4 with image stabilization is good enough. It is a 1000 bucks difference after all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mounts-and-tripods\">Mounts and Tripods:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Nodal Ninja with RD16 €449</li>\n<li>Manfrotto 055CXPRO4 or 190CXPRO4 ~€200 (not sure, both cost about the same. I am open for other less pricey brands as well)</li>\n<li>I already have a ball head</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This setup is pretty fixed. I like the Nodal Ninja and I have a ball head. I am open for a less expensive tripod, but given the quality of Manfrotto, €200 isn&rsquo;t too bad, really.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remotes\">Remotes:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Promote ~€380</li>\n<li>Canon tc-80n3 ~€140</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&rsquo;m unsure about the MK3&rsquo;s bracketing as it only offers 1EV steps at maximum. The Promote would allow me to control that better, but it is double of the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; (and already rather pricey) Canon remote.</p>\n<h3 id=\"all-the-other-stuff-one-needs-and-that-sucks-money-away\">All the other stuff one needs and that sucks money away:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sandisk Compact Flash Extreme 32GB 60MB/s (I really don&rsquo;t see the point of going faster then 60 MB/s I&rsquo;m not planning to do much video with it) ~€75 a pop about three or four of these</li>\n<li>Pelican card case ~€40</li>\n<li>DELOCK Card Reader-FireWire ~€50</li>\n<li>Hama Lenspen ~€12</li>\n<li>Peli 1510 Carry On Case ~€300 or a nice huge backpack that can fit all of this gear.

Usually when I am on set, I either rent or get equipment from the production that is hiring me. Now I am about to build my own camera kit and to stay halfway reasonable I want to stay around €6000, though I can go over that amount to get a better kit if need be. And it looks like I might have to. \n\nI thought I'd ask you guys for opinions on what to get and if I maybe can switch around a few things to get the most bang for my buck. Also, writing it all down is more for my benefit really, as it allows me to think through things better. \n\nThe goal is to build a kit that works well in four different situations:\n\n* Professional:\n\t* Set photography (making reference photos, shooting textures, making set HDRis, etc.)\n\t* Panorama photography (HDRi and normal panoramas)\n* Personal:\n\t* Since I am a rather new dad (boy, 10 months) I will use the camera for child photography. He is already a speedy little guy and I only see this getting more intense as time moves on.\n\t* Also, we own three ferrets who are even speedier.\n\nSo all things considered, I am looking to build a kit that serves well for kid and animal photography as well as on set photography.\n\n## The List\n\nSo far my list looks like this (all prices are not yet researched for cheapness but mostly straight off of Amazon):\n\n### Cameras:\n* Canon 7D ~€1200\n* Canon 5D Mark III ~€2600\n* Canon 5D Mark II ~€2300\n\nI am itching for the full frame sensor. Getting the older MK2 doesn't seem to make much sense as it was still rather expensive when I looked.\n\nThe 7D I am unsure about. Yes, it is cheaper, but also not a full frame sensor. However, I could use the saved money to get more/better glass. \n\nAnother added benefit of the less then full frame sensor is that is allows me to capture a higher resolution panorama with the 8mm Sigma at the cost of needing one or two more shots to get a full 360° panorama. So higher res, but slower workflow. \n\n### Lenses:\n\nThe options are:\n\n* Sigma 8mm Fisheye ~€750\n* Canon 50mm F1.2 (~€1400) or F1.4 (~€300)\n* Canon 70-200mm f2,8 ~€1000 (without image stabilization) or -2000 (with image stabilization)\n* Canon 70-200mm ~€1000 (or I go f4 with image stabilization)\n* Canon 20mm f2.8 ~€450\n* Canon EF 16-35mm 1:2,8L II USM ~€1300\n* Sigma 35 mm f/1,4 DG HSM ~€800\n* Canon EF 35mm 1:1,4 L USM ~€1300\n* Canon 24-70mm f2.8 ~€2000\n* Canon Extender EF 2x III ~€480\n\nI am only sure about the 8mm Sigma and pretty sure I want to get a 70-200mm, but inbetween I am torn. Get a 50mm prime or a 24-70mm zoom? Maybe a 35mm? 85mm?\n\nI do like the added quality and speed of a prime lens. For my main use case, which will be professional panorama photography, I think I'm going to go 8mm (standard, quick on-set pano HDR), 20mm (high-res on-set HDR pano) and 50mm (for those gigapanos and child photography). \n\nThe 70-200mm will be used for capturing textures and general on-set photography. Still not sure if I want the added quality of the f2.8 or if the f4 with image stabilization is good enough. It is a 1000 bucks difference after all.\n\n### Mounts and Tripods:\n* Nodal Ninja with RD16 €449\n* Manfrotto 055CXPRO4 or 190CXPRO4 ~€200 (not sure, both cost about the same. I am open for other less pricey brands as well)\n* I already have a ball head\n\nThis setup is pretty fixed. I like the Nodal Ninja and I have a ball head. I am open for a less expensive tripod, but given the quality of Manfrotto, €200 isn't too bad, really.\n\n### Remotes:\n* Promote ~€380\n* Canon tc-80n3 ~€140\n\nI'm unsure about the MK3's bracketing as it only offers 1EV steps at maximum. The Promote would allow me to control that better, but it is double of the \"simple\" (and already rather pricey) Canon remote.\n\n### All the other stuff one needs and that sucks money away:\n* Sandisk Compact Flash Extreme 32GB 60MB/s (I really don't see the point of going faster then 60 MB/s I'm not planning to do much video with it) ~€75 a pop about three or four of these\n* Pelican card case ~€40\n* DELOCK Card Reader-FireWire ~€50\n* Hama Lenspen ~€12\n* Peli 1510 Carry On Case ~€300 or a nice huge backpack that can fit all of this gear. I'm open for suggestions here.\n* a ruler of known length for matchmoving purposes\n* greyball 18% grey\n* Spyder Cube (was thinking of taking this instead of the grey ball as it is easier to get then 18% grey paint p lus it is very portable) ~€50\n* LightCraft Variable ND Fader ND MKII ~€100\n* B+W Cirkular Polarizer Käsemann F-Pro MRC DH 77mm ~€120\n* Leatherman Wave ~€70\n* X-Rite MSCCPP Passport ColorChecker ~€70\n* Leica D2 Laser measure ~€110\n* Bosch auto levelling laser cross ~€50\n* Canon battery packs LP-E6 ~€50\n* Suunto Pm-5 Clinometer ~€150\n* various self printed lens charts and tracking markers\n* tapes a whole bunch of them\n\n### Software\n\n* Aperture (which I already have)\n* ptGUI (which I also already have)\n\nQuite the list, eh?\n\nI think the stuff at the bottom is pretty much locked in (and already a hefty 1300 bucks price tag), but I am pretty uncertain how to balance the stuff at the top, especially lenses.\n\nAny ideas?\n",

You likely already have the technology available to you. For one OpenSubdiv is open source and all the licensing for the technology is available for free as well. Also, if you use Maya, you have access to all this already. Maya uses the exact same algorithm Pixar uses since Maya 5.0 and now also has the GPU implementation through Viewport 2.0.\n\nSo no excuses, get cranking!\n\n----\n\nSubtitle: Talk by Bill Polson, Director of Industry Strategy, Pixar\n",

I'm there every year reporting for Professional Production Magazine and I thought this year I could up my game and write little short blurbs on this blog about the sessions I attend.

And the magic word is <em>workflow</em>. We are working on pretty heavy projects most of the time. HD material (even if the output will be PAL in the end), 2K material for film or lots of layers or 3D layers. All that stuff is by definition slow. Especially if you work in a more complex setup then one or two layers. Add to that, that we are working in a network based environment and you get a workflow slow as molasses.</p>\n<p>There are a few things you can to do help pretty much every program to work faster.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don’t work in full resolution</li>\n<li>Don’t turn on all the effects, just because it looks better</li>\n<li>Don’t work over the network</li>\n<li>THINK before you work</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"dont-work-in-full-resolution\">Don’t work in full resolution</h4>\n<p>Yes, I know, you just built the most sexy motion graphics ever and you feel like looking at it over and over again, while tears run down your cheeks. Don’t.</p>\n<p>Your first responsibility is to work as fast as you can, because that allows for making it even better and being more flexible when the customer has last minute changes. It is of little importance to look at your masterpiece in 100% resolution and highest quality most of the time. Don’t use these settings until you really need them to judge the final output quality.\u2028\nFor all other cases go ahead and turn down the display size to 50% and the display quality to a third or a proxy of a third. Some applications even offer the option to go one step lower in quality as soon as you move things around. Use that.</p>\n<p>Another thing you should think about is the use of proxies. A proxy is a lower resolution version of your footage. So instead of working on HD material you work on PAL or half PAL material. After Effects and shake both support the automatic use of proxies. That means they automatically switch from low-res to high-res version as needed.\nTo see how that is done, have a look at the tutorial video, that describes it in more detail.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dont-turn-on-all-the-effects-just-because-it-looks-better\">Don’t turn on all the effects, just because it looks better</h4>\n<p>Yes, that 3D lighting in AfterEffects is sexy. But if you are working on font sizes, it is absolutely irrelevant. So switch it off. Same goes for every other effect that slows you down, but has no effect on the part you are working on at the moment (Motion Blur, other kinds of blurs, re-timing, heavy 3D, particles, you name it). It is much faster to switch off 5 effects, do a change and switch them on again, then trying to make a change while waiting 5-10 seconds for the screen to update.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dont-work-over-the-network\">Don’t work over the network</h4>\n<p>You might have a pretty fast network, but when 10-20 people work with HD or 2K footage over the network it slows down. Nothing that can be done about that. Except to copy your source material to a local drive. That will be way faster to work with then waiting for your bits and bytes to trickle through the cable.</p>\n<h4 id=\"think-before-you-work\">THINK before you work</h4>\n<p>Seems pretty obvious, right? Try to think before you start working.</p>\n<p>Working locally is fast. But if it takes 2 hours to copy footage to make a 10 minute change, then it might not be the most efficient way of working.</p>\n<p>Generating proxies is cool if you work on a shot for several hours or days. But generating proxies takes time as well. It might be faster to just open a file, do a quick change and render it out again.</p>\n<p>Assess the situation and act accordingly. But don’t get lazy!! If you see a benefit, do it!</p>\n",

THINK before you work\n\n#### Don’t work in full resolution\n\nYes, I know, you just built the most sexy motion graphics ever and you feel like looking at it over and over again, while tears run down your cheeks. Don’t.\n\nYour first responsibility is to work as fast as you can, because that allows for making it even better and being more flexible when the customer has last minute changes. It is of little importance to look at your masterpiece in 100% resolution and highest quality most of the time. Don’t use these settings until you really need them to judge the final output quality.\u2028\nFor all other cases go ahead and turn down the display size to 50% and the display quality to a third or a proxy of a third. Some applications even offer the option to go one step lower in quality as soon as you move things around. Use that.\n\nAnother thing you should think about is the use of proxies. A proxy is a lower resolution version of your footage. So instead of working on HD material you work on PAL or half PAL material. After Effects and shake both support the automatic use of proxies. That means they automatically switch from low-res to high-res version as needed.\nTo see how that is done, have a look at the tutorial video, that describes it in more detail.\n\n#### Don’t turn on all the effects, just because it looks better\n\nYes, that 3D lighting in AfterEffects is sexy. But if you are working on font sizes, it is absolutely irrelevant. So switch it off. Same goes for every other effect that slows you down, but has no effect on the part you are working on at the moment (Motion Blur, other kinds of blurs, re-timing, heavy 3D, particles, you name it). It is much faster to switch off 5 effects, do a change and switch them on again, then trying to make a change while waiting 5-10 seconds for the screen to update.\n\n#### Don’t work over the network\n\nYou might have a pretty fast network, but when 10-20 people work with HD or 2K footage over the network it slows down. Nothing that can be done about that. Except to copy your source material to a local drive. That will be way faster to work with then waiting for your bits and bytes to trickle through the cable.\n\n#### THINK before you work\n\nSeems pretty obvious, right? Try to think before you start working.\n\nWorking locally is fast. But if it takes 2 hours to copy footage to make a 10 minute change, then it might not be the most efficient way of working.\n\nGenerating proxies is cool if you work on a shot for several hours or days. But generating proxies takes time as well. It might be faster to just open a file, do a quick change and render it out again.\n\nAssess the situation and act accordingly. But don’t get lazy!! If you see a benefit, do it!\n",

Well, now I add two more options to the mix.</p>\n<p>First I created a modified version of Mattesons’ script to work with [Colloquy] <a href=\"http://colloquy.info/\">8</a> — my favourite IRC chat client (Which I also use for IQC, MSN, Jabber and IRC via the help of [BitlBee] <a href=\"http://www.bitlbee.org/\">9</a>). This worked out pretty straightforward and nice — and can be downloaded here (for setup instructions go to [Coda Hale’s page] <a href=\"http://blog.codahale.com/2007/01/15/tweet-twitter-quicksilver/\">3</a>). But then I thought it is stupid to have to change my status message of my chat client outside my chat client. So I sat down a little while longer and created a Colloquy script that posts to Twitter — including Growl notifications.</p>\n<p>This script works like the normal <code>/me</code> commands in IRC but also posts the text behind the <code>/me</code> command to Twitter. Users of Colloquy should know what it does, but for you non-IRC people, <code>/me</code> creates an _action_ message so <code>/me is hungry</code> becomes <em>AlexK (my nickname) is hungry</em>.

So just sit tight.</p>\n<p>Now you can use it with the commands <code>/tweet</code> or <code>/twitter</code> like so <code>/tweet is testing out this cool plugin</code>. It should send and action message to your current chatroom (Nickname is testing out this cool plugin) and also to your Twitter account (Username is testing out this cool plugin). After it succeeded you will get a Growl notification.</p>\n<p>On first use you will be asked if it is ok that the script gets access to your Keychain. This is fine and you should allow that. On first usage it might also take a little bit longer, but from then on it should run pretty fast. At least it does so over here.</p>\n<p>###Caveats</p>\n<p>I have one guy who had problems with it running very slow (up to 15 seconds), but over here is runs pretty much realtime.

				"content_html": "<p>Well, guess what? As I already thought it would happen, some people don’t seem to like the conclusions of my test. Zealots are so easy to predict and so hard to please.</p>\n<p>####“You cannot do it like this. Testing the renderers with a simple teapot in the scene is totally unfair!”</p>\n<p>Well, huh? How can a teapot be unfair? It is a simple geometry for crying out loud! If I had used a sphere or a torus (something not obviously produced by Pixar) it wouldn’t have made a difference.</p>\n<p>####“You didn’t use the right MotionBlur Settings, that is unfair!”</p>\n<p>Well, true, MentalRay also has something called Rapid Motion Blur. But that sucks too. I didn’t include it for two reasons. (1) It sucks. Or in a longer version: Every time I tried it, I got major render artifacts, so I just didn’t consider it for this test. (2) It sucks. Longer version: It is still way slower then Renderman for Maya.\nWell, my bad, I should have included it for sake of comparison.</p>\n<p>####“You didn’t tweak MentalRay right, there is way more to tweak to make it faster!”</p>\n<p>Well, it wasn’t part of this test to find out which renderer I can waste the most time with. In my business it is important to get results fast. Every minute spent at tweaking render times is nearly the same as rendering a slow renderer. Because if I spent two hours at tweaking or loose two hours due to bad render settings doesn’t matter. In the commercial business I have to deliver.

				"content_text": "\nWell, guess what? As I already thought it would happen, some people don’t seem to like the conclusions of my test. Zealots are so easy to predict and so hard to please. \n\n####“You cannot do it like this. Testing the renderers with a simple teapot in the scene is totally unfair!”\n\nWell, huh? How can a teapot be unfair? It is a simple geometry for crying out loud! If I had used a sphere or a torus (something not obviously produced by Pixar) it wouldn’t have made a difference.\n\n####“You didn’t use the right MotionBlur Settings, that is unfair!”\n\nWell, true, MentalRay also has something called Rapid Motion Blur. But that sucks too. I didn’t include it for two reasons. (1) It sucks. Or in a longer version: Every time I tried it, I got major render artifacts, so I just didn’t consider it for this test. (2) It sucks. Longer version: It is still way slower then Renderman for Maya.\nWell, my bad, I should have included it for sake of comparison.\n\n####“You didn’t tweak MentalRay right, there is way more to tweak to make it faster!”\n\nWell, it wasn’t part of this test to find out which renderer I can waste the most time with. In my business it is important to get results fast. Every minute spent at tweaking render times is nearly the same as rendering a slow renderer. Because if I spent two hours at tweaking or loose two hours due to bad render settings doesn’t matter. In the commercial business I have to deliver. Fast.\n\nIn my tests there was nearly no tweaking involved for Renderman (which I knew nothing about before these tests), but quite a bit to make MentalRay to look even that good (which I have worked with for quite some time now). In my book that means MentalRay is slower (and yes slower means also that it has more knobs to tweak it and loose time in the process).\n\n####“Sure Renderman is great, but Renderman for Maya is a completely different product. You can’t compare that!”\n\nWell, yes and no. It is about RfM, but the only difference to PRman is the interface and what you can do with it. The rendering engine is 100% the same. So what goes for one, goes for the other, too. With the addition that PRman is more configurable.\nSame goes for MentalRay for Maya. It is an interface for the MentalRay renderer.

				"title": "Directory Structures and Workflow - Part 01",
				"content_html": "<p>Last week we spoke about naming conventions, which got inspired by a topic covered on [Lifehacker] <a href=\"http://www.lifehacker.com/software/file-management/ask-the-readers-filing-naming-conventions-210104.php\">1</a> and [43 Folders] <a href=\"http://www.43folders.com/2006/10/23/file-naming/\">2</a>. A great start to a more streamlined workflow. But what good is a great filename, when you are unable to find your files in the chaotic folder structure you might have?</p>\n<p>For exactly this reason we will talk about how to get an optimized folder structure for multi-media projects. I will obviously have a bias to look at it from a compositors/3D guys/VFX supervisors view, but I am also able to accommodate you editors and other departments.</p>\n<p>What we will end up with is an understanding of what is important in a file and folder structure, so you are able to easily adjust the two templates, that we will discuss, to your needs.</p>\n<p>###Template No.1 - General purpose environment</p>\n<p>This template is geared to a more editing heavy workflow as it seems to be the case in most small TV commercial shops. It also has its room for 3D and compositing, but those are mere means to pimp the editing.</p>\n<p>As the main structure we divide into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>scene files</li>\n<li>materials</li>\n<li>sound</li>\n<li>output</li>\n<li>provals</li>\n<li>scratch</li>\n<li>temp</li>\n</ul>\n<p>####Scene files</p>\n<p>Obviously all the saved scenes from the involved programs — like FinalCut, Maya, shake or AfterEffects — go in here into their own subfolder. Now these may vary depending on your tools, but at them moment our scene files substructure looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FinalCut</li>\n<li>DVD</li>\n<li>Maya</li>\n<li>Shake</li>\n<li>Combustion</li>\n<li>Compressor</li>\n<li>Other</li>\n<li>Temp</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you notice there is a temp folder just like in the main structure. These are supposed to be the brainstorm areas of the folder structure.

				"content_text": "\nLast week we spoke about naming conventions, which got inspired by a topic covered on [Lifehacker] [1] and [43 Folders] [2]. A great start to a more streamlined workflow. But what good is a great filename, when you are unable to find your files in the chaotic folder structure you might have?\n\nFor exactly this reason we will talk about how to get an optimized folder structure for multi-media projects. I will obviously have a bias to look at it from a compositors/3D guys/VFX supervisors view, but I am also able to accommodate you editors and other departments.\n\nWhat we will end up with is an understanding of what is important in a file and folder structure, so you are able to easily adjust the two templates, that we will discuss, to your needs.\n\n###Template No.1 - General purpose environment\n\nThis template is geared to a more editing heavy workflow as it seems to be the case in most small TV commercial shops. It also has its room for 3D and compositing, but those are mere means to pimp the editing.\n\nAs the main structure we divide into:\n\n* scene files\n* materials\n* sound\n* output\n* provals\n* scratch\n* temp\n\n####Scene files\n\nObviously all the saved scenes from the involved programs — like FinalCut, Maya, shake or AfterEffects — go in here into their own subfolder. Now these may vary depending on your tools, but at them moment our scene files substructure looks like:\n\n* FinalCut\n* DVD\n* Maya\n* Shake\n* Combustion\n* Compressor\n* Other\n* Temp\n\nAs you notice there is a temp folder just like in the main structure. These are supposed to be the brainstorm areas of the folder structure. Everything that goes in here is just dabbling and will not be backed up and the Temp folders will be deleted at the end of the project.\n\nNow depending on the tool you might want or need to go deeper with your folders. For example, Maya has its own project structure. You could use the default one in the above Maya directory or you could adjust it, so it takes advantage of the folder template we are just creating — which would be a wise choice, because you don’t want to have several folders with the same meaning hanging around.\n\n####Materials\n\nMaterials is everything coming in from the outside world. Graphics from the client, video clips, sound bytes, word documents and storyboards. All that goes in here.\n\nAgain depending on your individual needs you may subdivide further into:\n\n* Graphics\n* Documents\n* Fonts\n* Subtitles\n* Video\n* Temp\n\nShould be pretty clear what to use when, right?\n\n####Sound\n\nOn most projects there will be sound involved. Music, sound effects, maybe speak. All that goes in here. Again within its own folder, like this:\n\n* Final Mix\n* Speak\n* Music\n* Sound Effects\n* DVD soundfiles\n* Temp\n\n####Output\n\nNow this is our catchall folder for renderings. We render uncompressed material for archiving. We also render back and forth from editing to VFX. The DVD department needs to receive files, etc.\n\nA folder structure like this looks reasonable:\n\n* Uncompressed\n* ->VFX\n* <-VFX\n* DVD\n* Sound\n* Temp\n\nThe first folder catches all the uncompressed output from editing. ->VFX is all the stuff that goes into the VFX department and needs 3D or compositing effects applied. The VFX department then renders back to editing (<-VFX) the finished effects.\n\nWhat the VFX department does when it has to render intermediate files you ask? That is a very good question. There are two ways to handle this in my opinion.\n\nThe correct way would be to render all the layers and pre-comps into Output/->VFX because it is something that goes again into the VFX land. I also tend to create a 3Drenders and a 2Drenders folder, so I can split up the sub-folders and files. Otherwise it might get a bit too crowded.\n\nThe lazy way would be to stay in the <-VFX folder. That has the advantage of staying in one folder all the time. Which means human error can be minimized. It happens all too easily that you accidentally render in the wrong VFX folder. And if you have to switch between the two folder (->VFX and <-VFX) all the time, then it might happen quite easily.\n\nDVD is obviously the folder where all the DVD files belong. All the m2v and m2a and vob’s and whatnot files only the DVD department can make use of.\n\n->Sound catches all the files that go to the sound editing as reference files.\n\nAnd Temp is the same as in all the other locations.\n\n####Approvals\n\nThis is just a simple folder where all the files the customer needs to approve are saved. Preview clips and such.\n\n####Scratch\n\nThis folder is similar to temp, but has a special meaning for the FinalCup folks. It is the folder where FinalCut renders all the internal caching and pre-render files.\n\n####Temp\n\nI said enough about the meaning of the Temp directories in the other paragraphs I think. As the name implies, the Temp folders are there for dabbling and trying things out. It will not be backed up and it also will be deleted at the end of the project.\n\nIt is a sandbox, a playground to try things out.\n\n####That’s all folks\n\nThat was a rundown on a basic production ready file and folder structure.
