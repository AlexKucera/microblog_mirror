Not only am I exclusively working from home these days—due to health reasons—but I am also working in a very reduced capacity. This means I am mostly using my iPhone, iPad, and iMac for leisure.\n\nWith that being said, here is what I use on a daily basis.\n\n## Keeping up with the Joneses\n\n### Micro.blog\n\nI said goodbye to social media a while ago. While I was quite active on Twitter and even more so on App.net and Slack, I have since dropped all of these. There really isn't much point in spinning my wheels there.\n\nThese days, I post to my own blog, which is syndicated to the Micro.blog timeline and also cross-posted to Mastodon. I'm not active on Mastodon, but thanks to the Fediverse, any replies I receive on Mastodon should appear on my Micro.blog timeline.\n\nPosting to my blog is done via the Micro.blog app or website, which is very frictionless for the most part.\n\n- My [Micro.blog Account](https://micro.blog/AlexKucera)\n- My [website](https://alexanderkucera.com)\n- My Fediverse ID: [@alex@alexanderkucera.com](@alex@alexanderkucera.com)\n\n### Fiery Feeds and FeedBin\n\nFor my daily news, I tend to watch the local news show [Tagesthemen](https://youtube.com/@tagesschau?si=DNoE4UhebBbcOiOz) while eating breakfast. This keeps me up to date on both local and global news and politics.\n\nFor my tech news and other updates, I use [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/home) to curate my feeds and [Fiery Feeds](https://voidstern.net/fiery-feeds) for reading them. Fiery Feeds has a few nice intelligent curation options, like Hot Links or Long and Short articles, that make it easy to catch up on too many RSS feeds every day.

Also the writing environment is not nearly as neat as Paper, even when I hide all the UI.\n\nOne advantage Bear has is that is supports images and other file formats in the notes. However, since it does not publish to Micro.blog that is of no help there as I still need to upload first and then include the link to the media file.\n\nThis is an online image test:\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/239/2024/3158a76118.png)\n\nAnd Bear seems to suffer from the same thing that plagues Bear. It does not export paragraphs properly. Or at least it treats paragraphs in the app differently then on export. A Markdown paragraph is denoted by a blank line between bodies of text. Both Paper and Bear show a simple line-break as new paragraph, but on export the paragraphs get lost due to no extra line break being added. Not terribly hard to work around, but worth noting.\n\nBut then again, Bear is about a third of the yearly cost. Which makes the choice actually harder and not easier.\n",

Or maybe I simply didn’t get it.\n\nThe idea of an endless scrolling timeline stresses me out. No unread count. You mean there is no indication of it ever ending? That sounds stress inducing to no end. \n\nWith my RSS reader (the now called Reeder Classic), I have a ton of feeds that are very high frequency that I only scan to see if something pops out. I have a folder called favorites that I scan more closely. At the end I mark both the „firehose“ and the favorites as read. The posts disappear and I am at ease that I got the most important bits. \n\nThen I open YouTube take a quick glance at what the homepage suggests. Usually junk. If there is something interesting it goes into my watch later queue. Then I scan my subscriptions. Same deal. Done. \n\nI do this once a days in the morning. Once. \n\nDuring the day I catch up on my Micro.blog feed, which is easy, becausee I only follow a couple of people compared to several hundreds I followed on Twitter. \n\nI don’t need much morere then this. My past self probably would be all over Tapestry and the new Reeder. In fact, I did use a timeline aggregation app about ten years ago from Realmac Software that is no longer available and whose name I have forgotten. They were way ahead of their time back then. Maybe they should dust it off as well.\n",

So if you want to grow your compositing skills beyond simply pressing a bunch of buttons and hope that the result is worthwhile stick around.\nI am going to work in Nuke, because it is very well suited for this “under the hood” way of working as it exposes a lot of technical info in its UI already. However, the concepts work the same in any other compositing package like Fusion, After Effects, Photoshop, Blender or Natron. Please refer to your manual for equivalent functions.\nIf you want to follow along you can download the Nuke Non-Commercial edition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"http://www.pixelfondue.com/blog/2017/2/7/compositing-bites-learning-compositing-one-node-at-a-time\">www.pixelfondue.com/blog/2017&hellip;</a></p>\n",

So if you want to grow your compositing skills beyond simply pressing a bunch of buttons and hope that the result is worthwhile stick around.\n>I am going to work in Nuke, because it is very well suited for this “under the hood” way of working as it exposes a lot of technical info in its UI already. However, the concepts work the same in any other compositing package like Fusion, After Effects, Photoshop, Blender or Natron. Please refer to your manual for equivalent functions.\n>If you want to follow along you can download the Nuke Non-Commercial edition.\n\nLink: [www.pixelfondue.com/blog/2017...](http://www.pixelfondue.com/blog/2017/2/7/compositing-bites-learning-compositing-one-node-at-a-time)\n",

				"title": "A New Path Trace Approach for \"Finding Dory\" - Christophe Hery - Pixar",
				"content_html": "<p><em>This post also appeared as part of a longer article on <a href=\"http://www.fxguide.com/quicktakes/day-1-at-fmx-2015-rendering-and-20-years-of-weta-digital/\">fxguide</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Christophe took us on a journey through the history of Renderman. From the basics of RSL (Renderman Shading Language) with its empirical shading to RSL 2.0 and the first steps in physically plausible shading to the new <a href=\"http://www.fxguide.com/featured/rendermanris-and-the-start-of-next-25-years/\">RIS</a> path tracing engine that allows physically accurate image creation.</p>\n<p>We started with RSL 1.2, which basically was state of the art in big budget productions up to 2005. It had the hallmarks of traditional computer graphics: light sources without any size or falloff (in fact, ILM usually didn&rsquo;t use falloff on lights at all even though an option for realistic light falloff existed) and of course idealized materials that had lots of dials for creative control without any regards to physically accuracy or energy conservation. One could easily create a surface that was brighter then any of the lights hitting it for example.</p>\n<p>With that creative freedom comes a lot of complexity though to get something that can be considered &ldquo;correct&rdquo; when it comes to realism, a required goalpost when you want to integrate your renderings into filmed footage.</p>\n<p>To get to an acceptable result quicker and with less complications, Pixar started to implement physically plausible rendering which was first used in Iron Man and later in Monster University to great effect. This proved that both realistic and stylized results were possible with this physically more accurate model despite it having less dials.</p>\n<p>While RSL 2.0 was quite successful it still had a few problems. Mainly it slowed down in complex raytracing setups due to Ray Hit Shading taking a lot of time and the memory usage exploded with complex scenes. This lead Pixar to develop a path tracing approach and a new render engine called RIS. For an in depth overview see last year&rsquo;s article on <a href=\"http://www.fxguide.com/featured/rendermanris-and-the-start-of-next-25-years/\">RIS</a>.</p>\n<p>RIS allows for even simpler controls, while rendering more accurately, faster and with less memory then the RSL approach.

				"content_text": "\n*This post also appeared as part of a longer article on [fxguide](http://www.fxguide.com/quicktakes/day-1-at-fmx-2015-rendering-and-20-years-of-weta-digital/).*\n\nChristophe took us on a journey through the history of Renderman. From the basics of RSL (Renderman Shading Language) with its empirical shading to RSL 2.0 and the first steps in physically plausible shading to the new [RIS](http://www.fxguide.com/featured/rendermanris-and-the-start-of-next-25-years/) path tracing engine that allows physically accurate image creation.\n\nWe started with RSL 1.2, which basically was state of the art in big budget productions up to 2005. It had the hallmarks of traditional computer graphics: light sources without any size or falloff (in fact, ILM usually didn't use falloff on lights at all even though an option for realistic light falloff existed) and of course idealized materials that had lots of dials for creative control without any regards to physically accuracy or energy conservation. One could easily create a surface that was brighter then any of the lights hitting it for example. \n\nWith that creative freedom comes a lot of complexity though to get something that can be considered \"correct\" when it comes to realism, a required goalpost when you want to integrate your renderings into filmed footage.\n\nTo get to an acceptable result quicker and with less complications, Pixar started to implement physically plausible rendering which was first used in Iron Man and later in Monster University to great effect. This proved that both realistic and stylized results were possible with this physically more accurate model despite it having less dials.\n\nWhile RSL 2.0 was quite successful it still had a few problems. Mainly it slowed down in complex raytracing setups due to Ray Hit Shading taking a lot of time and the memory usage exploded with complex scenes. This lead Pixar to develop a path tracing approach and a new render engine called RIS. For an in depth overview see last year's article on [RIS](http://www.fxguide.com/featured/rendermanris-and-the-start-of-next-25-years/).\n\nRIS allows for even simpler controls, while rendering more accurately, faster and with less memory then the RSL approach. Shaders are now fully integrated but very modular, which allows for easy debugging or switching out whole block for quickly getting different results. \n \n*Finding Dory*, which is currently in production at Pixar, is the first movie that is using RIS. In fact, Dory is the first use of what Christophe calls the RUKUS pipeline: RIS, [USD](http://graphics.pixar.com/usd/) a new interchange format developed at Pixar similar to Alembic and Katana.

				"title": "My iPhone App Playlist",
				"content_html": "<p>In the spirit of app recommendation lists that keep popping up everywhere I decided to make my own. I do have a lot of iOS apps. In fact, I went a little overboard in 2012 and the first half of 2013. So much so that after I added up the amount of money I spent on app purchases, I went on a very strict app feast for the rest of 2013.</p>\n<p>Anyway, my point is that I have tried a lot of apps and a couple stuck leading to the top apps I use today. Each category is in order of importance to my way of working. Well more or less. Halfway through I wasn&rsquo;t able to decide on the proper order, so higher up is generally more important to me, but it&rsquo;s a sliding scale the further down you get.</p>\n<h2 id=\"quick-links\">Quick Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#internet\">Internet Apps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#productivity\">Productivity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#media\">Media</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#shopping\">Shopping</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"internet\">Internet Apps</h2>\n<p>While Internet is a pretty broad term, I use it to designate apps that are used to interact with the online world.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/felix-iphone-edition/id562447652?mt=8\">Felix</a>\nWithout doubt still my favorite <a href=\"http://app.net\">App.net</a> client. It has gotten pretty slow on my iPhone 4, but I still keep coming back to it every day. Felix definitely is a top contender to the &ldquo;most used app&rdquo; spot.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunstroke/id488564806?mt=8\">Sunstroke</a>\nFor my news reading I am using a <a href=\"http://feedafever.com/\">Fever</a> install on my server. Sunstroke is without a doubt the best way to access my Fever feeds on the iPhone and I have tried pretty much every Fever compatible iPhone client out there. It is not as versatile as <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8\">Mr. Reader</a> on the iPad for sharing out items, but from a pure reading perspective I have yet to find a better app.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-5-for-twitter/id580311103?mt=8\">Twitteriffic</a></p>\n<p>I hardly use <a href=\"https://twitter.com\">Twitter</a> anymore these days. <a href=\"http://app.net\">App.net</a> has almost completely replaced the service with the bird for me. However, a lot of my colleagues still use it and I need a way to occasionally respond to DMs and mentions. Twitteriffic is a beautiful and more then adequate Twitter client for this job.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articles/id364881979?mt=8\">Articles</a></p>\n<p>For my <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a> research I prefer to use a dedicated client like Articles. This is one area where I grabbed the client that looked best for me way back when I got my first iPhone and I just never tried another one. So there might be better Wikipedia clients out there, but Articles suits me just fine.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dict.cc-dictionary/id327732352?mt=8\">dict.cc</a></p>\n<p>While my English is reasonably good, I do need to look up words once in a while. I found dict.cc a pretty good dictionary. Plus it is an offline dictionary, which is still something I rely on occasionally in spots with bad reception.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weatherpro/id294631159?mt=8\">WeatherPro</a></p>\n<p>I usually check the weather by looking out the window—now there&rsquo;s a revolutionary idea! But when I need to look up the weather at a travel destination or to check a forecast for the upcoming week WeatherPro has proven to be the most reliable app for Germany and Europe in general. And it has nice detailed statistical infos and weather radar imagery. Not that I could make heads or tails of those, but they look nice.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outbank/id585564091?mt=8\">Outbank</a></p>\n<p>For German bank accounts there is nothing better then Outbank. It is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and it actually works with a wide array of banks. While I don&rsquo;t check my accounts daily, Outbank is certainly the cornerstone of my own digital accounting and that of our business.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screens-vnc-access-your-computer/id655890150?mt=8\">Screens VNC</a></p>\n<p>Another one of these &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use often, but critical when I do&rdquo; apps. Screens allows me to quickly fix things on our server even when I am hundreds of kilometers away from home. Together with Screens Connect, its desktop counterpart, setup is a breeze and I don&rsquo;t have to trouble myself with ports and SSL, etc. It just works.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pushpin-for-pinboard/id548052590?mt=8\">Pushpin</a></p>\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://pinboard.in\">Pinboard</a> for everything bookmarking related, including keeping a downloadable archive of the bookmark, meaning if the page you bookmarked goes offline, you&rsquo;ll still be able to see the archived copy indefinitely.</p>\n<p>And a big feature for me is that I use Pinboard as Instapaper replacement. Pushpin is the client that helps me achieve that last part. Right now it is a basic way to browse my bookmarks and catch up on my unread items. However, there is a feature in the works that will make my goal of using Pinboard and Instapaper replacement complete: Offline reading. I don&rsquo;t know when exactly it is coming, but I was assured it is coming and when the day comes it will be glorious. Or so I hope…</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8\">Dropbox</a>{#dropbox}</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t use the app that often, but it is very comforting to know that I have the option. Getting at anything in my Dropbox within a matter of seconds is truly convenient.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/facetime/\">FaceTime</a></p>\n<p>Skype can suck it. Especially since Microsoft took over and ruined the app even more. &lsquo;Nuff said.</p>\n<p>##Productivity {#productiviy}</p>\n<p>Productivity is such a loaded word that I try to avoid it. In this case I really am referring to apps that allow me to do work or to keep track of stuff.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8\">1Password</a></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to survive without 1Password. I&rsquo;d have to use the same password everywhere or juggle paper lists or something. Madness would ensue pretty quickly I am sure.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, AgileBits has me covered in the insanity department. 1Password is the first app I install on any machine. And since it syncs via Dropbox I can access my password library <a href=\"http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/1passwordanywhere.html\">even when I am on a random computer with Internet access</a>.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/begin-your-daily-to-do-list/id687455038?mt=8\">Begin</a></p>\n<p>Great little to do list app. Simple and very bare bones. Just what I need. I also have Omnifocus, but rarely use it. Begin I actually do use. It is a refreshing take on the old paradigm of creating lists to check off.</p>\n<p>###Mail.app</p>\n<p>What can I say? I rely on email and I find the default mail app to be very much sufficient. I have used Sparrow in the past, but with iOS 7 I switched back to the default app and haven&rsquo;t looked back.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8\">Drafts</a></p>\n<p>While I prefer to write on my iPad, I do use Drafts on the iPhone to sketch out quick ideas or as simple pasteboard. Sync with the Drafts for iPad app is instantaneous, so I can start a thought on my iPhone and continue it on my iPad in Drafts or <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8\">Editorial</a> without effort.</p>\n<p>I have set up a nice little array of custom actions in Drafts, which allows me to use it as a plain text journaling app or as a quick entry bucket for story ideas.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calendars-5-smart-calendar/id697927927?mt=8\">Calendars 5</a></p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/fantastical-2/id718043190?mt=8\">Fantastical</a> before Calendars, but as it turns out Calendars has the same natural language event creation, but a much nicer calendar interface. I don&rsquo;t use a calendar that often really, but it is always a pleasure to use Calendars 5 when I have to.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite-best-free-calculator/id300311831?mt=8\">PCcalc</a></p>\n<p>Powerful, quick, to the point. When I need to use a calculator this is the one I turn to. It allows me to be as simple or as complex in my calculations as I need to be and it can do so much more like convert units. Though for unit conversion I tend to use <a href=\"#vert\">Vert</a>.</p>\n<p>I linked to the free version above as that is already plenty powerful and if you so desire you can upgrade its functionality to suit your needs, which is exactly what I have done.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vert-2-unit-currency-converter/id691346630?mt=8\">Vert</a>{#vert}</p>\n<p>Vert is another one of those laser focused apps without any cruft, a concept that I seem to really gravitate to, don&rsquo;t I? Vert does exactly what it says on the tin. It converts a wide array of units and does so in a fast and efficient manner.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outliner/id284455726?mt=8\">CarbonFin Outliner</a></p>\n<p>Sometimes I need a list that is neither a todo list nor a full outline or mindmap. CarbonFin Outliner fills that niche nicely. It is very much alike the famous <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner\">OmniOutliner</a> condensed down for iPhone. It can be used as todo list app or as full blown outliner with comments and the likes. But it is clean enough that I can use it for my simple list making.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"http://www.navigon.com/portal/us/produkte/navigationssoftware/mobile_navigator_iphone_us.html\">Navigon</a></p>\n<p>The only turn by turn navigation I use. It is accurate, regularly updated with up to date map data and is generally nice to use.</p>\n<p>From the looks of it my global version of Navigon isn&rsquo;t offered any longer on the App Store. Instead there are several region based apps at a cheaper price.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/db-navigator/id343555245?mt=8\">DB Navigator</a></p>\n<p>The app of the German railway services. More of a nuisance then a must have, but it is better then juggling paper tickets.</p>\n<p>##Media {#media}</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-high-fidelity-podcasts/id723142770?mt=8\">Castro</a>\nThe new kid on the podcast client block has bedazzled me from the day it came out. Yes, it is very minimal in its feature set. However, I found that it actually offers all the features I need and not more. Before I was using <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/instacast-3/id577056377?mt=8\">Instacast</a> and lately <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8\">Downcast</a>, both great apps, but much too fiddly.</p>\n<p>I am so much happier with Castro and without feature bloat. Give it a try. You might like it.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audiobooks-from-audible/id379693831?mt=8\">Audible</a></p>\n<p>I cannot say enough good things about Audible. I love the way their service works. I love audiobooks. I love this app. That plus the fact that the support is simply awesome. Recently I found out that you can return two books a year within a year of purchase for a full refund without challenge from the staff. How awesome is that?</p>\n<p>I highly recommend a membership with them.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/naturespace-relax-meditate/id312618509?mt=8\">Naturespace</a></p>\n<p>Sometimes I need to switch off my brain completely or shut out the world. Naturespace is brilliant for that. It offers a great collection of high quality nature sounds that really transport you to the recorded location when you close your eyes.</p>\n<p>Listening to nature is a poor mans replacement to actually going outside, but it is worlds better then blasting my ears with music all day or using white noise to drown out environmental distractions.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera+/id329670577?mt=8\">Camera+</a></p>\n<p>My preferred quick and dirty image editor on the go. It has some nice filters and allows for some quick edits. And it allows me to share my pictures quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>There are other similar image editors like VSCO Cam (which I won&rsquo;t link to, because I despise it), but they all are too slow, ugly or have horrible filters in my opinion.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filterstorm-neue/id728479183?mt=8\">Filterstorm Neue</a></p>\n<p>Now this is a real work horse. Where Camera+ is my <em>Instagram</em> app, Filterstorm is my image editor on the go. It is pretty amazing what the developer has managed to pull of here. Quick, high quality editing on a tiny screen and excellent sharing options including direct FTP upload.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autostitch-panorama/id318944927?mt=8\">AutoStitch</a></p>\n<p>I do love panoramas.

				"content_text": "\nIn the spirit of app recommendation lists that keep popping up everywhere I decided to make my own. I do have a lot of iOS apps. In fact, I went a little overboard in 2012 and the first half of 2013. So much so that after I added up the amount of money I spent on app purchases, I went on a very strict app feast for the rest of 2013.\n\nAnyway, my point is that I have tried a lot of apps and a couple stuck leading to the top apps I use today. Each category is in order of importance to my way of working. Well more or less. Halfway through I wasn't able to decide on the proper order, so higher up is generally more important to me, but it's a sliding scale the further down you get.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n* [Internet Apps](#internet)\n* [Productivity](#productivity)\n* [Media](#media)\n* [Shopping](#shopping)\n\n## Internet Apps {#internet}\nWhile Internet is a pretty broad term, I use it to designate apps that are used to interact with the online world.\n\n###[Felix](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/felix-iphone-edition/id562447652?mt=8)\nWithout doubt still my favorite [App.net](http://app.net) client. It has gotten pretty slow on my iPhone 4, but I still keep coming back to it every day. Felix definitely is a top contender to the \"most used app\" spot.\n\n###[Sunstroke](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunstroke/id488564806?mt=8)\nFor my news reading I am using a [Fever](http://feedafever.com/) install on my server. Sunstroke is without a doubt the best way to access my Fever feeds on the iPhone and I have tried pretty much every Fever compatible iPhone client out there. It is not as versatile as [Mr. Reader](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8) on the iPad for sharing out items, but from a pure reading perspective I have yet to find a better app.\n\n###[Twitteriffic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-5-for-twitter/id580311103?mt=8)\n\nI hardly use [Twitter](https://twitter.com) anymore these days. [App.net](http://app.net) has almost completely replaced the service with the bird for me. However, a lot of my colleagues still use it and I need a way to occasionally respond to DMs and mentions. Twitteriffic is a beautiful and more then adequate Twitter client for this job.\n\n###[Articles](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articles/id364881979?mt=8)\n\nFor my [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) research I prefer to use a dedicated client like Articles. This is one area where I grabbed the client that looked best for me way back when I got my first iPhone and I just never tried another one. So there might be better Wikipedia clients out there, but Articles suits me just fine.\n\n###[dict.cc](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dict.cc-dictionary/id327732352?mt=8)\n\nWhile my English is reasonably good, I do need to look up words once in a while. I found dict.cc a pretty good dictionary. Plus it is an offline dictionary, which is still something I rely on occasionally in spots with bad reception.\n\n###[WeatherPro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weatherpro/id294631159?mt=8)\n\nI usually check the weather by looking out the window—now there's a revolutionary idea! But when I need to look up the weather at a travel destination or to check a forecast for the upcoming week WeatherPro has proven to be the most reliable app for Germany and Europe in general. And it has nice detailed statistical infos and weather radar imagery. Not that I could make heads or tails of those, but they look nice.\n\n###[Outbank](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outbank/id585564091?mt=8)\n\nFor German bank accounts there is nothing better then Outbank. It is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and it actually works with a wide array of banks. While I don't check my accounts daily, Outbank is certainly the cornerstone of my own digital accounting and that of our business.\n\n###[Screens VNC](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screens-vnc-access-your-computer/id655890150?mt=8)\n\nAnother one of these \"don't use often, but critical when I do\" apps. Screens allows me to quickly fix things on our server even when I am hundreds of kilometers away from home. Together with Screens Connect, its desktop counterpart, setup is a breeze and I don't have to trouble myself with ports and SSL, etc. It just works.\n\n###[Pushpin](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pushpin-for-pinboard/id548052590?mt=8)\n\nI use [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) for everything bookmarking related, including keeping a downloadable archive of the bookmark, meaning if the page you bookmarked goes offline, you'll still be able to see the archived copy indefinitely.\n\nAnd a big feature for me is that I use Pinboard as Instapaper replacement. Pushpin is the client that helps me achieve that last part. Right now it is a basic way to browse my bookmarks and catch up on my unread items. However, there is a feature in the works that will make my goal of using Pinboard and Instapaper replacement complete: Offline reading. I don't know when exactly it is coming, but I was assured it is coming and when the day comes it will be glorious. Or so I hope…\n\n###[Dropbox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8){#dropbox}\n\nI don't use the app that often, but it is very comforting to know that I have the option. Getting at anything in my Dropbox within a matter of seconds is truly convenient.\n\n###[FaceTime](http://www.apple.com/ios/facetime/)\n\nSkype can suck it. Especially since Microsoft took over and ruined the app even more. 'Nuff said.\n\n##Productivity {#productiviy}\n\nProductivity is such a loaded word that I try to avoid it. In this case I really am referring to apps that allow me to do work or to keep track of stuff.\n\n###[1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8)\n\nI don't think I'd be able to survive without 1Password. I'd have to use the same password everywhere or juggle paper lists or something. Madness would ensue pretty quickly I am sure. \n\nThankfully, AgileBits has me covered in the insanity department. 1Password is the first app I install on any machine. And since it syncs via Dropbox I can access my password library [even when I am on a random computer with Internet access](http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/1passwordanywhere.html).\n\n###[Begin](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/begin-your-daily-to-do-list/id687455038?mt=8)\n\nGreat little to do list app. Simple and very bare bones. Just what I need. I also have Omnifocus, but rarely use it. Begin I actually do use. It is a refreshing take on the old paradigm of creating lists to check off.\n\n###Mail.app\n\nWhat can I say? I rely on email and I find the default mail app to be very much sufficient. I have used Sparrow in the past, but with iOS 7 I switched back to the default app and haven't looked back.\n\n###[Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8)\n\nWhile I prefer to write on my iPad, I do use Drafts on the iPhone to sketch out quick ideas or as simple pasteboard. Sync with the Drafts for iPad app is instantaneous, so I can start a thought on my iPhone and continue it on my iPad in Drafts or [Editorial](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8) without effort.\n\nI have set up a nice little array of custom actions in Drafts, which allows me to use it as a plain text journaling app or as a quick entry bucket for story ideas.\n\n###[Calendars 5](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calendars-5-smart-calendar/id697927927?mt=8)\n\nI used [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/app/fantastical-2/id718043190?mt=8) before Calendars, but as it turns out Calendars has the same natural language event creation, but a much nicer calendar interface. I don't use a calendar that often really, but it is always a pleasure to use Calendars 5 when I have to.\n\n###[PCcalc](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite-best-free-calculator/id300311831?mt=8)\n\nPowerful, quick, to the point. When I need to use a calculator this is the one I turn to. It allows me to be as simple or as complex in my calculations as I need to be and it can do so much more like convert units. Though for unit conversion I tend to use [Vert](#vert).\n\nI linked to the free version above as that is already plenty powerful and if you so desire you can upgrade its functionality to suit your needs, which is exactly what I have done.\n\n###[Vert](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vert-2-unit-currency-converter/id691346630?mt=8){#vert}\n\nVert is another one of those laser focused apps without any cruft, a concept that I seem to really gravitate to, don't I? Vert does exactly what it says on the tin. It converts a wide array of units and does so in a fast and efficient manner.\n\n###[CarbonFin Outliner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outliner/id284455726?mt=8)\n\nSometimes I need a list that is neither a todo list nor a full outline or mindmap. CarbonFin Outliner fills that niche nicely. It is very much alike the famous [OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner) condensed down for iPhone. It can be used as todo list app or as full blown outliner with comments and the likes. But it is clean enough that I can use it for my simple list making.\n\n###[Navigon](http://www.navigon.com/portal/us/produkte/navigationssoftware/mobile_navigator_iphone_us.html)\n\nThe only turn by turn navigation I use. It is accurate, regularly updated with up to date map data and is generally nice to use. \n\nFrom the looks of it my global version of Navigon isn't offered any longer on the App Store. Instead there are several region based apps at a cheaper price.\n\n###[DB Navigator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/db-navigator/id343555245?mt=8)\n\nThe app of the German railway services. More of a nuisance then a must have, but it is better then juggling paper tickets.\n\n##Media {#media}\n\n###[Castro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-high-fidelity-podcasts/id723142770?mt=8)\nThe new kid on the podcast client block has bedazzled me from the day it came out. Yes, it is very minimal in its feature set. However, I found that it actually offers all the features I need and not more. Before I was using [Instacast](https://itunes.apple.com/app/instacast-3/id577056377?mt=8) and lately [Downcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8), both great apps, but much too fiddly. \n\nI am so much happier with Castro and without feature bloat. Give it a try. You might like it.\n\n###[Audible](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audiobooks-from-audible/id379693831?mt=8)\n\nI cannot say enough good things about Audible. I love the way their service works. I love audiobooks. I love this app. That plus the fact that the support is simply awesome. Recently I found out that you can return two books a year within a year of purchase for a full refund without challenge from the staff. How awesome is that?\n\nI highly recommend a membership with them.\n\n###[Naturespace](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/naturespace-relax-meditate/id312618509?mt=8)\n\nSometimes I need to switch off my brain completely or shut out the world. Naturespace is brilliant for that. It offers a great collection of high quality nature sounds that really transport you to the recorded location when you close your eyes. \n\nListening to nature is a poor mans replacement to actually going outside, but it is worlds better then blasting my ears with music all day or using white noise to drown out environmental distractions.\n\n###[Camera+](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera+/id329670577?mt=8)\n\nMy preferred quick and dirty image editor on the go. It has some nice filters and allows for some quick edits. And it allows me to share my pictures quickly and painlessly.\n\nThere are other similar image editors like VSCO Cam (which I won't link to, because I despise it), but they all are too slow, ugly or have horrible filters in my opinion.\n\n###[Filterstorm Neue](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filterstorm-neue/id728479183?mt=8)\n\nNow this is a real work horse. Where Camera+ is my *Instagram* app, Filterstorm is my image editor on the go. It is pretty amazing what the developer has managed to pull of here. Quick, high quality editing on a tiny screen and excellent sharing options including direct FTP upload.\n\n###[AutoStitch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autostitch-panorama/id318944927?mt=8)\n\nI do love panoramas. While the iOS panorama feature looks neat, my iPhone 4 is unable to use it. Also, I usually need more then a single horizontal strip of photos for my panoramas. \n\nAutoStitch is the best panorama app I have found. I can throw any amount of images at it snapped in all kinds of angles and it stitches them into a coherent panorama at a great quality and at up to 18 megapixels if I so desire.\n\n###[CameraSync](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camerasync/id406645727?mt=8)\n\nOnce my images have been taken and edited, I upload them to [Dropbox](#dropbox), my main storage location for all my pictures. CameraSync does so automatically in the background with a good selection of powerful options including the ability to prevent screenshots and videos from being uploaded if one so wishes.\n\n###[Unbound](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unbound-for-dropbox/id586086921?mt=8)\n\nAfter my images have uploaded with CameraSync I tend to delete them from my device. Unbound allows me to browse my complete image library from [Dropbox](#dropbox) in a nice interface.\n\n###[Paprika](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-for/id406732590?mt=8)\n\nA cooking app isn't exactly media, but it is the only category that semi-fit. Paprika is a great recipe app, because it is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and the recipes are synced between the devices. I can type in a new recipe when I am away for work and my wife can cook the dish at home a minute later or vice versa. Perfect.\n\n##Shopping {#shopping}\n\n###[Amazon](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-app/id297606951?mt=8)\n\nI get **everything** from Amazon. The app is at the same time convenient and really not great to use. But it is better then the website at least from the iPhone, so I'm using it.\n\n###[Kickstarter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kickstarter-for-iphone/id596961532?mt=8)\n\nHi. My name is Alex and I have a Kickstarter addiction.\n\nSeriously though, I love browsing [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) projects in the app for awesome projects, while at the same time hoping that there won't be, so I don't feel compelled to throw money out the window.\n\nI really should delete this app…\n\n###[Delivery Status Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/delivery-status-touch-package/id290986013?mt=8)\n\nThe best way to track where my shipments are at. Fullstop. Again a service that syncs across iOS and OS X. Those are really the most versatile, aren't they?\n\n## Summary\n\nPew, that was quite the list. While I don't use everything on this list daily and these are by far not the only apps I have installed on my iPhone, I would consider this group of apps essential for my daily work and play. I hope there were some nuggets in there for you [#teamappdiction](https://alpha.app.net/hashtags/teamappdiction) people. :)\n",

				"title": "The Creative Cringe",
				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m reading <a href=\"http://app.net/shawnblanc\">Shawn Blanc&rsquo;s</a> wonderful book <a href=\"https://shawnblanc.net/thedetails/\">Delight is in the Details</a> and this one chapter rings especially true with me. It&rsquo;s about what I like to call <em>the creative cringe</em>, the feeling everyone of us gets when we see our work and are not satisfied with it or where we see all the little and not so little flaws that make us cringe.</p>\n<p>Shawn is quoting <a href=\"http://youtu.be/PbC4gqZGPSY\">Ira Glass</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>„All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste — the thing that got you into the game — is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it’s normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions.

				"content_text": "\nI'm reading [Shawn Blanc's](http://app.net/shawnblanc) wonderful book [Delight is in the Details](https://shawnblanc.net/thedetails/) and this one chapter rings especially true with me. It's about what I like to call *the creative cringe*, the feeling everyone of us gets when we see our work and are not satisfied with it or where we see all the little and not so little flaws that make us cringe. \n\nShawn is quoting [Ira Glass](http://youtu.be/PbC4gqZGPSY):\n\n> „All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste — the thing that got you into the game — is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it’s normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone[…]“\n\nI'm very much afflicted by this phenomenon.

It sounds complicated, but is actually rather straightforward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://getkirby.com\">Kirby</a>, of course.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/\">Drafts</a> (or any other editor that allows you to send stuff to Editorial via <a href=\"http://x-callback-url.com/\">x-callback URLs</a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://omz-software.com/editorial/\">Editorial</a>, <a href=\"http://omz-software.com/pythonista/index.html\">Pythonista</a> works equally well, but Editorial is simpler to set up, plus you can write in Editorial as well and just skip <em>Drafts</em> entirely, which is what I do most of the time.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://filterstormneue.com\">Filterstorm Neue</a> or alternatively Photoforge 2 if you still have access to it.</li>\n<li>Dropbox</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.noodlesoft.com\">Hazel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.crushftp.com\">CrushFTP</a>, optional, but depending on the image editor you use more convenient</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"kirby\">Kirby</h3>\n<p>First of all, why Kirby? Sounds like an awful lot of work for something that Tumblr offers for free. Tumblr even has an iOS app. Just log in and be done with it.</p>\n<p>For me it comes down to owning what I create. And that involves hosting  what I create. Yes, Kirby is a little more involved and— <em>gasp</em> —costs money, but it is really flexible—I built several sites with it for myself, friends and even customers—, fast and pretty cheap considering.</p>\n<p>Plus it works with text files and Markdown, both things that I value dearly and that make this specific workflow possible without a special &ldquo;<em>Kirby iOS app</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"drafts-optional\">Drafts (optional)</h3>\n<p><em>For completeness sake I&rsquo;m including my Drafts workflow as well. However, I have since completely switched over to Editorial for writing as well as post-processing my posts.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I started writing my posts in Agile Tortoise&rsquo;s Drafts, a fine and frictionless text editor with the added bonus that it supports the x-callback URL scheme and a ton of other ways to share or manipulate the written word.</p>\n<p>When I write a blog entry, I put the post&rsquo;s title in the first line and the actual post content right after it. If I want a subtitle, that goes at the very bottom with the tag <code>Subtitle:</code></p>\n<p>So a typical post in Drafts would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>This is my title\n\nAnd this is my content.\nIt can have any content. Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it.\n\n----\n\nSubtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle.\n</code></pre>\n<p>When it comes time to share my post with the world, I have a Dropbox action called <em>Blog Post</em>, that will create a file in a designated Dropbox folder—I have a global <em>Apps</em> folder and I put it in a subfolder there—with the name of my post title as filename. It will also fill in a couple of things for me. Most notably the date and the title. So the above post transforms into:</p>\n<p>&lsquo;<code>This is my title.md</code>&rsquo; with the following content:</p>\n<pre><code>Title: This is my title\n\n----\n\nDate: 07.11.13 (used for display purposes)\n\n----\n\nTime: 2013-11-07-17-33-55 (used for sorting purposes)\n\n----\n\nAnd this is my content.\nIt can have any content. Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it.\n\n----\n\nSubtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can import this action into Drafts by clicking this link: <a href=\"drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=dropbox&amp;name=Blog%20Post&amp;path=%2FApps%2FDrafts%2FKirby%2FBlog%2F&amp;filenametype=1&amp;filename=&amp;ext=md&amp;writetype=0&amp;template=Title%3A%20%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0ADate%3A%20%5B%5Bdate%7C%25d.%25m.%25Y%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0ATime%3A%20%5B%5Btime%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0AText%3A%20%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D\">→ Import Blog Posts action into Drafts</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"editorial\">Editorial</h3>\n<p><em>This first part is part of the old Drafts workflow. Jump to the second part to see how I&rsquo;m working right now.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"the-old-way\">The <em>old</em> way</h4>\n<p>The next two steps are only for the times I want or need images in my posts or if I want to create one of those snazzy banners that are sorely underrepresented in my blog.</p>\n<p>I use Editorial as a simple text filter in this case. I could write something like this for Pythonista to make it work on iPhone (Editorial is iPad only), but I, well, I didn&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>\n<p>Editorial simply gives me back the future path of my new blog post, something I need if I want to drop pictures into that folder without hunting for the correct folder in my next step.</p>\n<p>I send over my post from Drafts to Editorial with a simple x-callback URL.</p>\n<p>You can import the URL Action into Drafts by clicking this link: <a href=\"drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=URL&amp;name=Copy%20Blog%20Path&amp;url=editorial%3A%2F%2F%3Fcommand%3D%7B%7Bcreate%20blog%20URL%7D%7D%26input%3D%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D\">→ Import URL action &ldquo;Copy Blog Path&rdquo; into Drafts</a></p>\n<p>Editorial then cleans it up in a variety of ways. For example, everything gets turned to lowercase, spaces are removed, etc.</p>\n<p>The resulting URL is copied to the clipboard. In the example above <code>This is my title</code> turns into <code>http://alexanderkucera.com/20131108-this_is_my_title</code>.</p>\n<p>I opted not to run any action after this, as I want to be able to switch to any app I want as the situation requires. But usually it is now on to <em>Filterstorm</em>.</p>\n<p>If you want to import the URL cleanup workflow into Editorial or simply read through it in detail, you can take a look at this <a href=\"http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5035202761981952/hTzXZVeWcLI\">&ldquo;create blog URL&rdquo; Editorial Action</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"the-new-way\">The <em>new</em> way</h4>\n<p>Since I have completely switched over from Drafts to Editorial, I had to create a workflow that would prep a standard Markdown document and turn it into a blog post. Since Editorial is much more powerful then Drafts, I was also able to make it a bit smarter, ask for input on a few things and optionally archive or delete a post once I&rsquo;m done with it.</p>\n<p>It does a lot of things similar to my Drafts workflow though. After all is said and done, a file with the correct naming scheme gets written to a Dropbox folder. And I also get the blog URL at the end from the workflow above.</p>\n<p>The bonus with the Editorial workflow is that I don&rsquo;t need to watch out for any specific formatting. I can have a standard Markdown document and everything <em>just works™</em>. And Editorial is just really pleasant to work in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5895905618165760/iEqPb0_XVkw\">Editorial Blog Posting Workflow</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"filterstorm-neue\">Filterstorm (Neue)</h3>\n<p>Filterstorm Neue, is brand new, but the old Filterstorm or Filterstorm Pro have pretty much the same abilities. Or you could use Photoforge 2 if you still have it. The important bit is that the app allows you to either <strong>export to Dropbox or to upload via FTP</strong> and to give your images <strong>a name of your choosing</strong>.</p>\n<p>Well, this step is really simple. Do your image edits. Done? Ok. Then upload it to the folder we just had the path created for in Editorial. Simple, right?</p>\n<p>Well, yes and no. There is one step that I consider crucial. I don&rsquo;t want to upload to my web server. I want to upload my image to Dropbox. I consider the Dropbox version of my site to be the canonical copy. Everything goes there first and then gets uploaded to the server. Otherwise I end up with a file mess. Files might get updated or changed here or there. Who knows? By always going Dropbox first, that issue gets sidestepped completely.</p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have an <em>always on</em> server machine, your best bet is to find a way to upload to Dropbox directly. Photoforge has a Dropbox uploading feature. Filterstorm does as well, though it involves browsing to your posts folder manually instead of just giving it a path.</p>\n<p>For various reasons, mostly because I don&rsquo;t want to hunt down a folder and I have the exact path I need from my Editorial workflow above, I decided to go a completely different route: FTP.</p>\n<p>I happen to use CrushFTP for work anyway, which means I just need to set up an FTP account that points to the blog&rsquo;s content folder in my server&rsquo;s Dropbox folder and the rest is very straightforward. Get path from Editorial and upload to said path.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hazel\">Hazel</h3>\n<p>The last and final step. The one step that unifies desktop and iOS blogging. Automatically uploading my posts from Dropbox to the server. Hazel is the perfect match for that. Especially since it got the ability to open an FTP connection on its own a couple of versions back.</p>\n<p>The Hazel flow goes like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look into the Drafts Or Editorial app folder and check if there is new post.</li>\n<li>Put the file into a subfolder called <code>&lt;date&gt;-postname</code>.</li>\n<li>Rename the file to <code>article.md</code> (the name of my Kirby layout template for a blog post)</li>\n<li>move the new folder with the post in it into my blog</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There another Hazel rule takes over as Hazel rules only ever can work on one folder at a time. It goes like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a folder? Look into it.</li>\n<li>Any file that doesn&rsquo;t have a red or grey color tag and that has been modified within the day gets uploaded</li>\n<li>After the upload color the file grey</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The color tags are there to stop Hazel from constantly uploading files that have been modified inside the &ldquo;today&rdquo; timeframe. But they also allow me to simply take off the color label if I want a file to be re-uploaded.</p>\n<p>Grab the Hazel ruleset here: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hazelrules.zip<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>The one called <code>Drafts-Editorial-Folder</code> is for the incoming Drafts or Editorial file and the one called <code>Kirby-Blog-Folder</code> monitors the Kirby blog folder.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-it\">That&rsquo;s it.</h2>\n<p>See? Simple, right?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Subtitle: Kirby, iOS, Drafts, Editorial, Filterstorm and Hazel tied into a neat bundle</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr\">Too long; Didn&rsquo;t read</a>&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

The path of said folder has been copied to the clipboard by the above Editorial workflow. \n\nHave Hazel put everything into place and let it upload to post to the web server. \n\n## The long version\n\nThere are several steps involved to make this work. It sounds complicated, but is actually rather straightforward.\n\n* [Kirby](http://getkirby.com), of course.\n* [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/) (or any other editor that allows you to send stuff to Editorial via [x-callback URLs](http://x-callback-url.com/)).\n* [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/), [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/index.html) works equally well, but Editorial is simpler to set up, plus you can write in Editorial as well and just skip *Drafts* entirely, which is what I do most of the time.\n* [Filterstorm Neue](http://filterstormneue.com) or alternatively Photoforge 2 if you still have access to it.\n* Dropbox\n* [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com)\n* [CrushFTP](http://www.crushftp.com), optional, but depending on the image editor you use more convenient\n\n### Kirby\n\nFirst of all, why Kirby? Sounds like an awful lot of work for something that Tumblr offers for free. Tumblr even has an iOS app. Just log in and be done with it.\n\nFor me it comes down to owning what I create. And that involves hosting  what I create. Yes, Kirby is a little more involved and— *gasp* —costs money, but it is really flexible—I built several sites with it for myself, friends and even customers—, fast and pretty cheap considering.\n\nPlus it works with text files and Markdown, both things that I value dearly and that make this specific workflow possible without a special \"*Kirby iOS app*\".\n\n### Drafts (optional)\n\n*For completeness sake I'm including my Drafts workflow as well. However, I have since completely switched over to Editorial for writing as well as post-processing my posts.*\n\n---\n\nI started writing my posts in Agile Tortoise's Drafts, a fine and frictionless text editor with the added bonus that it supports the x-callback URL scheme and a ton of other ways to share or manipulate the written word.\n\nWhen I write a blog entry, I put the post's title in the first line and the actual post content right after it. If I want a subtitle, that goes at the very bottom with the tag `Subtitle:`\n\nSo a typical post in Drafts would look like this:\n\n\t\n\tThis is my title\n\t\n\tAnd this is my content.\n\tIt can have any content. Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it.\n\t\n\t----\n\t\n\tSubtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle.\n\nWhen it comes time to share my post with the world, I have a Dropbox action called *Blog Post*, that will create a file in a designated Dropbox folder—I have a global *Apps* folder and I put it in a subfolder there—with the name of my post title as filename. It will also fill in a couple of things for me. Most notably the date and the title. So the above post transforms into:\n\n'`This is my title.md`' with the following content:\n\n\tTitle: This is my title\n\t\n\t----\n\n\tDate: 07.11.13 (used for display purposes)\n\n\t----\n\n\tTime: 2013-11-07-17-33-55 (used for sorting purposes)\n\n\t----\n\t\n\tAnd this is my content.\n\tIt can have any content. Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it.\n\t\n\t----\n\t\n\tSubtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle.\n\t\nYou can import this action into Drafts by clicking this link: [→ Import Blog Posts action into Drafts](drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=dropbox&name=Blog%20Post&path=%2FApps%2FDrafts%2FKirby%2FBlog%2F&filenametype=1&filename=&ext=md&writetype=0&template=Title%3A%20%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0ADate%3A%20%5B%5Bdate%7C%25d.%25m.%25Y%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0ATime%3A%20%5B%5Btime%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0AText%3A%20%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D)\n\n### Editorial\n\n*This first part is part of the old Drafts workflow. Jump to the second part to see how I'm working right now.*\n\n---\n\n#### The *old* way\n\nThe next two steps are only for the times I want or need images in my posts or if I want to create one of those snazzy banners that are sorely underrepresented in my blog.\n\nI use Editorial as a simple text filter in this case. I could write something like this for Pythonista to make it work on iPhone (Editorial is iPad only), but I, well, I didn't feel like it.\n\nEditorial simply gives me back the future path of my new blog post, something I need if I want to drop pictures into that folder without hunting for the correct folder in my next step.\n\nI send over my post from Drafts to Editorial with a simple x-callback URL.\n\nYou can import the URL Action into Drafts by clicking this link: [→ Import URL action \"Copy Blog Path\" into Drafts](drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=URL&name=Copy%20Blog%20Path&url=editorial%3A%2F%2F%3Fcommand%3D%7B%7Bcreate%20blog%20URL%7D%7D%26input%3D%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D)\n\nEditorial then cleans it up in a variety of ways. For example, everything gets turned to lowercase, spaces are removed, etc.\n\nThe resulting URL is copied to the clipboard. In the example above `This is my title` turns into `http://alexanderkucera.com/20131108-this_is_my_title`.\n\nI opted not to run any action after this, as I want to be able to switch to any app I want as the situation requires. But usually it is now on to *Filterstorm*.\n\nIf you want to import the URL cleanup workflow into Editorial or simply read through it in detail, you can take a look at this [\"create blog URL\" Editorial Action](http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5035202761981952/hTzXZVeWcLI)\n\n#### The *new* way\n\nSince I have completely switched over from Drafts to Editorial, I had to create a workflow that would prep a standard Markdown document and turn it into a blog post. Since Editorial is much more powerful then Drafts, I was also able to make it a bit smarter, ask for input on a few things and optionally archive or delete a post once I'm done with it. \n\nIt does a lot of things similar to my Drafts workflow though. After all is said and done, a file with the correct naming scheme gets written to a Dropbox folder. And I also get the blog URL at the end from the workflow above.\n\nThe bonus with the Editorial workflow is that I don't need to watch out for any specific formatting. I can have a standard Markdown document and everything *just works™*. And Editorial is just really pleasant to work in. \n\n[Editorial Blog Posting Workflow](http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5895905618165760/iEqPb0_XVkw)\n\n### Filterstorm (Neue)\n\nFilterstorm Neue, is brand new, but the old Filterstorm or Filterstorm Pro have pretty much the same abilities. Or you could use Photoforge 2 if you still have it. The important bit is that the app allows you to either **export to Dropbox or to upload via FTP** and to give your images **a name of your choosing**.\n\nWell, this step is really simple. Do your image edits. Done? Ok. Then upload it to the folder we just had the path created for in Editorial. Simple, right?\n\nWell, yes and no. There is one step that I consider crucial. I don't want to upload to my web server. I want to upload my image to Dropbox. I consider the Dropbox version of my site to be the canonical copy. Everything goes there first and then gets uploaded to the server. Otherwise I end up with a file mess. Files might get updated or changed here or there. Who knows? By always going Dropbox first, that issue gets sidestepped completely.\n\nIf you don't have an *always on* server machine, your best bet is to find a way to upload to Dropbox directly. Photoforge has a Dropbox uploading feature. Filterstorm does as well, though it involves browsing to your posts folder manually instead of just giving it a path.\n\nFor various reasons, mostly because I don't want to hunt down a folder and I have the exact path I need from my Editorial workflow above, I decided to go a completely different route: FTP. \n\nI happen to use CrushFTP for work anyway, which means I just need to set up an FTP account that points to the blog's content folder in my server's Dropbox folder and the rest is very straightforward. Get path from Editorial and upload to said path.\n\n### Hazel\n\nThe last and final step. The one step that unifies desktop and iOS blogging. Automatically uploading my posts from Dropbox to the server. Hazel is the perfect match for that. Especially since it got the ability to open an FTP connection on its own a couple of versions back.\n\nThe Hazel flow goes like this:\n\n* Look into the Drafts Or Editorial app folder and check if there is new post.\n* Put the file into a subfolder called `<date>-postname`.\n* Rename the file to `article.md` (the name of my Kirby layout template for a blog post)\n* move the new folder with the post in it into my blog\n\nThere another Hazel rule takes over as Hazel rules only ever can work on one folder at a time. It goes like this:\n\n* Is there a folder? Look into it.\n* Any file that doesn't have a red or grey color tag and that has been modified within the day gets uploaded\n* After the upload color the file grey\n\nThe color tags are there to stop Hazel from constantly uploading files that have been modified inside the \"today\" timeframe. But they also allow me to simply take off the color label if I want a file to be re-uploaded.\n\nGrab the Hazel ruleset here: <a href=\"https://alexanderkucera.com/uploads/2024/hazelrules.zip\">hazelrules.zip</a>\n\nThe one called `Drafts-Editorial-Folder` is for the incoming Drafts or Editorial file and the one called `Kirby-Blog-Folder` monitors the Kirby blog folder.\n\n## That's it.\n\nSee? Simple, right?\n\n----\n\nSubtitle: Kirby, iOS, Drafts, Editorial, Filterstorm and Hazel tied into a neat bundle\n",

Which sounds like a lot, but it really isn't if you do the math.\n\nAnyway, the developers did a remarkable job of translating the Shadowrun experience into a playable and infinitely expandable game. The environments are gorgeous, the first story that came with it is pretty solid and supposed to be about 12 hours of gameplay.\n\nYou can really only tell that they needed to cut stuff by the lack of detail in the characters. They just feel a little unpolished at times. The 3D characters that is. The character art is top notch. \n\nAnother thing that's sorely missing to give the game that extra bit of atmosphere is a voice over track. It's just a little lackluster to read all the dialogue. But I guess with the idea of an editor that allows you to expand the game ad infinitum, a VO track seems a little unrealistic. \n\nBut in the end, [Shadowrun Returns](http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun) remains a great, atmospheric game and anyone even mildly into the Shadowrun universe owes himself to check it out. \n\n----\n\nSubtitle: Game Review\n",
