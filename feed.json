I&rsquo;ve been dealing with chronic illness for 12 years now, and somewhere in that span, I let friendships slip. Some of them have been silent for almost a decade. I carry guilt about that—the kind that whispers, “They probably think you don&rsquo;t care” and “You&rsquo;re a bad friend.”</p>\n<p>But I&rsquo;m done with that narrative. This year, I&rsquo;m reconnecting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-guilt-is-lying-to-you\">The guilt is lying to you</h2>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what stopped me from reaching out: I assumed old friends would feel like strangers to me, and that I&rsquo;d be a burden showing up after years of silence. I assumed they&rsquo;d resent the gap or wouldn&rsquo;t care anymore.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2022/07/friends-enjoy-being-reached\">Research shows</a> that people consistently underestimate how much others appreciate an unexpected reach-out. The hesitation lives in you, not in them.</p>\n<p>The other thing that stopped me: energy. Chronic illness means my social bandwidth is limited. I can&rsquo;t do the friend maintenance that healthy people do. But <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11332216/\">research</a> on dormant friendships suggests that reconnections often feel surprisingly natural—they can feel like no time has passed at all when you reconnect.</p>\n<p>So the guilt is partly wrong, and the energy barrier is partly solvable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-plan-a-hybrid-approach\">My plan: a hybrid approach</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not going to pretend I can do 1:1 personalized outreach to five or six people right now. That would drain me, I’d get overwhelmed, and nothing would happen. Instead, I&rsquo;m writing one core message—authentic, brief, honest—and then adjusting it slightly for each person. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s my initial contact strategy.</p>\n<p>The message will do three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Acknowledge the gap without over-explaining</strong>: “I know I&rsquo;ve been out of touch. Life got complicated, and chronic illness made me pull back from a lot.”</li>\n<li><strong>Be honest about why I&rsquo;m reaching out now</strong>: “I&rsquo;ve been thinking about you, and I realized I don&rsquo;t want to let this friendship die.”</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it low-pressure</strong>: “No expectations. Just wanted to reconnect if you&rsquo;re open to it.”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the template. Then I adjust slightly per person—maybe mention a specific memory, or reference something I know about their life. Nothing exhausting. Just enough to show I actually know them.</p>\n<p>If they respond and a real conversation starts, that becomes 1:1. Real relationship. But the initial contact? Efficient. Sustainable. Honest about my constraints.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-battery-principle\">The battery principle</h2>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the reality: getting in touch takes energy. Not a ton, but some. So I&rsquo;m building in real limitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The initial outreach takes battery</strong>. I’ll do it in batches—maybe one or two reach-outs per week, not all at once.</li>\n<li><strong>Responses take energy</strong>. I won&rsquo;t pressure myself to reply immediately.

				"content_text": "![Auto-generated description: Drei Kinder sitzen auf einer Bank und umarmen sich, während sie in eine Landschaft schauen.](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/239/2026/img-0414.jpg)\nIt's January 2026. I've been dealing with chronic illness for 12 years now, and somewhere in that span, I let friendships slip. Some of them have been silent for almost a decade. I carry guilt about that—the kind that whispers, “They probably think you don't care” and “You're a bad friend.”\n\nBut I'm done with that narrative. This year, I'm reconnecting.\n\n## The guilt is lying to you\n\nHere's what stopped me from reaching out: I assumed old friends would feel like strangers to me, and that I'd be a burden showing up after years of silence. I assumed they'd resent the gap or wouldn't care anymore.\n\n[Research shows](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2022/07/friends-enjoy-being-reached) that people consistently underestimate how much others appreciate an unexpected reach-out. The hesitation lives in you, not in them.\n\nThe other thing that stopped me: energy. Chronic illness means my social bandwidth is limited. I can't do the friend maintenance that healthy people do. But [research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11332216/) on dormant friendships suggests that reconnections often feel surprisingly natural—they can feel like no time has passed at all when you reconnect.\n\nSo the guilt is partly wrong, and the energy barrier is partly solvable.\n\n## My plan: a hybrid approach\n\nI'm not going to pretend I can do 1:1 personalized outreach to five or six people right now. That would drain me, I’d get overwhelmed, and nothing would happen. Instead, I'm writing one core message—authentic, brief, honest—and then adjusting it slightly for each person. That's it. That's my initial contact strategy.\n\nThe message will do three things:\n\n1. **Acknowledge the gap without over-explaining**: “I know I've been out of touch. Life got complicated, and chronic illness made me pull back from a lot.”\n2. **Be honest about why I'm reaching out now**: “I've been thinking about you, and I realized I don't want to let this friendship die.”\n3. **Keep it low-pressure**: “No expectations. Just wanted to reconnect if you're open to it.”\n\nThat's the template. Then I adjust slightly per person—maybe mention a specific memory, or reference something I know about their life. Nothing exhausting. Just enough to show I actually know them.\n\nIf they respond and a real conversation starts, that becomes 1:1. Real relationship. But the initial contact? Efficient. Sustainable. Honest about my constraints.\n\n## The battery principle\n\nHere's the reality: getting in touch takes energy. Not a ton, but some. So I'm building in real limitations:\n\n- **The initial outreach takes battery**. I’ll do it in batches—maybe one or two reach-outs per week, not all at once.\n- **Responses take energy**. I won't pressure myself to reply immediately. Asynchronous is fine.\n- **If a conversation deepens, that takes more energy**. I’ll be honest about that if needed: “I’m excited to catch up, but I need to manage my energy. Could we do a shorter call?” Real friends understand.\n- **Sometimes I’ll need to say no**. If someone wants to meet in person and I don’t have the battery for it, I’ll decline gracefully and offer an alternative.\n\nThe principle: do what's sustainable, not what's “supposed to.”\n\n## What I'm not doing this year\n\nI'm not setting up a quarterly reminder system yet. I'm not creating a spreadsheet. I'm not overcomplicating this. The goal is reconnection, not optimization. Once I've actually reconnected with these people, then I figure out the maintenance rhythm. But first: reach out.\n\n## Intent\n\nThese friendships matter to me. The silence was never about not caring—it was about being overwhelmed and sick and guilty and stuck. But I'm unstuck now. Or at least, I'm willing to try.\n\nIn 2026, I'm sending those messages. I'm reconnecting with the people who've been in my life. I'm betting that the friendship is still there, even after the gap. And I'm doing it in a way that doesn't wreck me.\n\nThat's the goal. That's the commitment.\n\n",

It&rsquo;s breathing properly and keeping my lungs clear. That&rsquo;s the foundation everything else sits on.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m doing these breathing exercises daily:</p>\n<p><strong>Diaphragmatic breathing</strong>— The basic one. I lie on my back, hand on my chest, hand on my belly. Breathe in through my nose so my belly rises, breathe out slowly through pursed lips. This activates my parasympathetic nervous system (the &ldquo;rest and digest&rdquo; one), which helps with both pain and anxiety. I do this for 5–10 minutes when I wake up, after meals, and before bed.</p>\n<p><strong>Stacked breathing</strong>— This is the one that research shows works best for pleural effusion specifically. I exhale completely, then take deep breaths on top of each other (stacking 2–4 of them) until my lungs feel full, hold for a count of 5, then exhale slowly. I do 3–5 cycles twice a day. If I feel dizzy or get chest pain, I stop immediately.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also tracking my temperature twice daily for the next 2–3 weeks. If it hits 38°C or higher, or if I suddenly get worse shortness of breath, that&rsquo;s when I call my doctor. Those are my red lines.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-timeline\">My Timeline</h2>\n<p><strong>Weeks 1–4 (Now through late January):</strong> Walking is my exercise. I&rsquo;m building from where I am now—short distances that don&rsquo;t aggravate the incision—toward 20 minutes twice daily. Walking slowly, deliberately, like I&rsquo;m with a toddler. The breathing exercises are the real work. I&rsquo;m also following the &ldquo;talk test&rdquo;: if I can&rsquo;t carry a conversation while moving, I&rsquo;m doing too much.</p>\n<p><strong>Weeks 5–8 (February–early March):</strong> This is when I introduce light resistance. Not the dumbbells yet—I mean resistance bands and very controlled movements. Seated exercises. Longer walks, maybe with a slight incline. My belly should be feeling better by then, but I&rsquo;m not pushing it.</p>\n<p><strong>Weeks 9–12 (Mid-March through April):</strong> Light strength work becomes real. I can start using my dumbbells, but starting light. Core activation work like modified planks and bridges. Low-impact cardio like rowing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/239/2026/img-0413.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0413.jpeg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Months 3–6 (May–June and beyond):</strong> Gradual return to normal. The goal by summer is to be able to play with my kids without thinking about my incision, to cook for my family without exhaustion, to move through my house and my life without it being a project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fuel-for-recovery\">Fuel for Recovery</h2>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t out-exercise a bad diet, and right now, diet is doing more for my recovery than anything else. My body needs specific nutrients to heal.</p>\n<p><strong>Protein</strong> is the foundation. I&rsquo;m aiming for 1.2–1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight daily. For me, that&rsquo;s real food: chicken breast, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, legumes, tofu. Protein at every meal, not just dinner. This is what actually rebuilds tissue.</p>\n<p><strong>Iron</strong> matters because surgery depletes it. I&rsquo;m eating lean red meat, spinach, and fortified cereals. Not obsessively—just making sure it&rsquo;s in my rotation. The same goes for <strong>zinc</strong> (oysters, seafood, lean beef, nuts), which accelerates healing, and <strong>vitamin C</strong> (citrus, berries, red peppers, broccoli), which builds the collagen my incision needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Fiber and water</strong> are the boring but critical ones. Pain medication constipates you, which is miserable on top of everything else. I&rsquo;m aiming for 25–30 grams of fiber daily and 1 liter of water. It&rsquo;s not glamorous, but it works.</p>\n<p>I am using the MacroFactor app to track my macros, but not obsessively so. Just to make sure I am on the right track. I&rsquo;m making sure I&rsquo;m eating protein at every meal, getting my vegetables in, and staying hydrated. Simple, sustainable, and it actually fuels recovery instead of just existing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"equipment\">Equipment</h2>\n<p>Right now I have a small dumbbell setup at home. It&rsquo;s fine for where I am, but as I progress, I&rsquo;m going to need something more flexible. A cable machine or multi-purpose workout rack would let me start with micro-weights (1–2.5 kg) that I&rsquo;ll actually be able to handle in early February, and scale up smoothly as I get stronger.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not looking for anything fancy. I want something that gives me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjustable resistance starting really low</li>\n<li>Smooth, controlled movements (no jarring)</li>\n<li>Multiple positions so I can work around my still-healing core</li>\n<li>Something that&rsquo;ll serve me well long-term, not just during recovery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll research the actual equipment once I&rsquo;m further along and have a clearer sense of what my space can handle and what my budget allows. For now, the dumbbells are enough.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accountability\">Accountability</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m writing this down—publicly, on my blog—because I need to be accountable to myself. Recovery isn&rsquo;t motivational. It&rsquo;s not fun. It&rsquo;s slow and frustrating and there are days when I wonder if my body will ever feel normal again.</p>\n<p>But the alternative is worse: staying sidelined, being unable to be fully present with my kids, unable to contribute to my family the way I want to, unable to just live.</p>\n<p>So this is my commitment: I&rsquo;m taking the first half of 2026 to heal properly. I&rsquo;m doing the breathing exercises even when they feel pointless. I&rsquo;m watching the pleural effusion like a hawk. I&rsquo;m walking when I don&rsquo;t feel like it. I&rsquo;m eating protein and getting good sleep and being honest about when I&rsquo;ve done too much.</p>\n<p>And by summer 2026, I&rsquo;m going to be able to do the things that matter.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the goal. That&rsquo;s the plan. And I&rsquo;m going to stick to it.</p>\n",

A cable machine or multi-purpose workout rack would let me start with micro-weights (1–2.5 kg) that I'll actually be able to handle in early February, and scale up smoothly as I get stronger.\n\nI'm not looking for anything fancy. I want something that gives me:\n- Adjustable resistance starting really low\n- Smooth, controlled movements (no jarring)\n- Multiple positions so I can work around my still-healing core\n- Something that'll serve me well long-term, not just during recovery\n\nI'll research the actual equipment once I'm further along and have a clearer sense of what my space can handle and what my budget allows. For now, the dumbbells are enough.\n\n## Accountability\n\nI'm writing this down—publicly, on my blog—because I need to be accountable to myself. Recovery isn't motivational. It's not fun. It's slow and frustrating and there are days when I wonder if my body will ever feel normal again.\n\nBut the alternative is worse: staying sidelined, being unable to be fully present with my kids, unable to contribute to my family the way I want to, unable to just live.\n\nSo this is my commitment: I'm taking the first half of 2026 to heal properly. I'm doing the breathing exercises even when they feel pointless. I'm watching the pleural effusion like a hawk. I'm walking when I don't feel like it. I'm eating protein and getting good sleep and being honest about when I've done too much.\n\nAnd by summer 2026, I'm going to be able to do the things that matter.\n\nThat's the goal. That's the plan. And I'm going to stick to it.\n",

				"content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hinweis</strong>: Dieser Artikel nimmt Bezug auf einen <a href=\"https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/rheinland-pfalz/ludwigshafen/denkmal-opfer-nationalsozialismus-juden-neustadt-geinsheim-100.html\">Artikel beim SWR</a>.\nDer Artikel war datiert auf den 23.10.2025 und stammte von Irmgard Reisinger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Am Sonntag wird in Geinsheim ein Mahnmal für die Opfer der Nazi-Diktatur eingeweiht. Ein wichtiges Moment. Ein richtiges Moment. Und gleichzeitig ein Moment, der einige unbequeme Fragen aufwirft.</p>\n<p>Fünf Jahre hat dieser Prozess gedauert. Der Artikel in der Rheinpfalz nennt es diplomatisch: &ldquo;Der Standort war umstritten.&rdquo; Der Bildhauer Bernhard Mathäss musste sich sogar <em>kurzzeitig aus dem Projekt zurückziehen</em>. Das klingt nicht nach breiter Einigkeit über den besten Weg, Opfer zu ehren.</p>\n<p>Und dann: Das Mahnmal soll neben dem Hähnchengrill aufgestellt werden. Die Begründung: &ldquo;Viele der jüdischen Mitbürger gingen damals dort in die Schule.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Okay. Aber hier die Frage, die im Raum steht: <strong>Warum nicht dort, wo früher die Synagoge stand?</strong> Wo Juden nicht nur &ldquo;mal zur Schule gingen&rdquo;, sondern wo sie beteten, wo ihr religiöses und kulturelles Leben stattfand? Das wäre doch der Ort, der die Geschichte wirklich <em>erzählt</em>?</p>\n<p>Stattdessen: Hähnchengrill.</p>\n<p>Es geht nicht darum, den Standort zu verdammen. Es geht darum, dass die Begründung etwas Seltsames offenbart – eine Art… Beiläufigkeit. &ldquo;Juden waren auch da.&rdquo; Das klingt weniger nach ernsthaftem Gedenken, mehr nach: <em>Schau, wie toll wir uns um Aufarbeitung kümmern.</em></p>\n<p>Und dann ist da noch die Sache mit der Namensliste. Monatelange Recherche, um die Namen der deportierten und ermordeten Menschen genau zu erfassen. Ein Arbeitskreis hat daran gearbeitet, Entscheidungen getroffen.</p>\n<p>Karl Linnenfelser und Clemens Stahler – beide Vorstand des Heimatvereins – gehörten auch diesem Arbeitskreis an. Der Heimatverein unter ihrer Verantwortung nutzte dann bei der Umsetzung eine andere Liste. Mit der Begründung: &ldquo;Das stand ja gar nicht im Protokoll.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rechtlich sauber. Menschlich fraglich.</p>\n<p>Das ist nicht einfach eine administrative Entscheidung. Das ist eine Entscheidung gegen die eigene Arbeitskreis-Arbeit. Und das wirft Fragen auf: Worum ging es wirklich? Um die 33 Namen? Oder um etwas anderes?</p>\n<p>Ein Mahnmal ist mehr als ein Objekt. Es ist ein Versprechen – das Versprechen, dass eine Gemeinde bereit ist, ihre Geschichte <em>wirklich</em> anzuschauen. Auch wenn es unbequem wird. Auch wenn es bedeutet, Fehler einzugestehen. Auch wenn es bedeutet, dass nicht alle Verantwortlichen am Ende auf die Schulter geklopft werden.</p>\n<p>In Geinsheim sieht es manchmal anders aus. Da sieht es aus, als müssten sich bestimmte Menschen auf die Schulter klopfen – egal wie der Prozess war, egal welche Entscheidungen ignoriert wurden.</p>\n<p>Am Sonntag wird das Mahnmal übergeben.

				"content_text": "> **Hinweis**: Dieser Artikel nimmt Bezug auf einen [Artikel beim SWR](https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/rheinland-pfalz/ludwigshafen/denkmal-opfer-nationalsozialismus-juden-neustadt-geinsheim-100.html).\n> Der Artikel war datiert auf den 23.10.2025 und stammte von Irmgard Reisinger.\n\nAm Sonntag wird in Geinsheim ein Mahnmal für die Opfer der Nazi-Diktatur eingeweiht. Ein wichtiges Moment. Ein richtiges Moment. Und gleichzeitig ein Moment, der einige unbequeme Fragen aufwirft.\n\nFünf Jahre hat dieser Prozess gedauert. Der Artikel in der Rheinpfalz nennt es diplomatisch: \"Der Standort war umstritten.\" Der Bildhauer Bernhard Mathäss musste sich sogar *kurzzeitig aus dem Projekt zurückziehen*. Das klingt nicht nach breiter Einigkeit über den besten Weg, Opfer zu ehren.\n\nUnd dann: Das Mahnmal soll neben dem Hähnchengrill aufgestellt werden. Die Begründung: \"Viele der jüdischen Mitbürger gingen damals dort in die Schule.\"\n\nOkay. Aber hier die Frage, die im Raum steht: **Warum nicht dort, wo früher die Synagoge stand?** Wo Juden nicht nur \"mal zur Schule gingen\", sondern wo sie beteten, wo ihr religiöses und kulturelles Leben stattfand? Das wäre doch der Ort, der die Geschichte wirklich *erzählt*?\n\nStattdessen: Hähnchengrill.\n\nEs geht nicht darum, den Standort zu verdammen. Es geht darum, dass die Begründung etwas Seltsames offenbart – eine Art… Beiläufigkeit. \"Juden waren auch da.\" Das klingt weniger nach ernsthaftem Gedenken, mehr nach: *Schau, wie toll wir uns um Aufarbeitung kümmern.*\n\nUnd dann ist da noch die Sache mit der Namensliste. Monatelange Recherche, um die Namen der deportierten und ermordeten Menschen genau zu erfassen. Ein Arbeitskreis hat daran gearbeitet, Entscheidungen getroffen.\n\nKarl Linnenfelser und Clemens Stahler – beide Vorstand des Heimatvereins – gehörten auch diesem Arbeitskreis an. Der Heimatverein unter ihrer Verantwortung nutzte dann bei der Umsetzung eine andere Liste. Mit der Begründung: \"Das stand ja gar nicht im Protokoll.\"\n\nRechtlich sauber. Menschlich fraglich.\n\nDas ist nicht einfach eine administrative Entscheidung. Das ist eine Entscheidung gegen die eigene Arbeitskreis-Arbeit. Und das wirft Fragen auf: Worum ging es wirklich? Um die 33 Namen? Oder um etwas anderes?\n\nEin Mahnmal ist mehr als ein Objekt. Es ist ein Versprechen – das Versprechen, dass eine Gemeinde bereit ist, ihre Geschichte *wirklich* anzuschauen. Auch wenn es unbequem wird. Auch wenn es bedeutet, Fehler einzugestehen. Auch wenn es bedeutet, dass nicht alle Verantwortlichen am Ende auf die Schulter geklopft werden.\n\nIn Geinsheim sieht es manchmal anders aus. Da sieht es aus, als müssten sich bestimmte Menschen auf die Schulter klopfen – egal wie der Prozess war, egal welche Entscheidungen ignoriert wurden.\n\nAm Sonntag wird das Mahnmal übergeben. Der Ort wird klatschen. Das ist gut so – die 33 Namen verdienen das. Aber vielleicht sollten wir trotzdem die Fragen stellen, die weh tun.\n\nDenn echtes Gedenken ist nicht einfach. Es sollte auch nicht einfach aussehen.\n",

You can explore more alternatives because the cost of prototyping is lower.\n\nYou can also tackle more ambitious projects because you have a force multiplier for the routine parts of development.\n\nBut this only works if you maintain rigorous standards for the output. The moment you start accepting \"good enough\" code because it was faster to generate, you've fallen into the trap that gives vibe coding a bad reputation.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nVibe coding isn't about replacing human judgment with AI automation. It's about strategic collaboration where AI handles routine tasks and pattern generation while humans provide oversight, refinement, and architectural guidance.\n\nThe quality of your code depends on the quality of your review process, not the tool you use to generate it. Whether you're working with an LLM or a junior developer, the principles remain the same: clear requirements, thorough review, iterative improvement, and unwavering standards.\n\nThe developers who succeed with AI assistance are those who understand this distinction. They're not looking for a replacement for their skills. They're looking for a tool that amplifies their capabilities while maintaining their responsibility for the final product.\n\nThat's what vibe coding really is. And when done right, it produces better code, not worse.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Eight weeks ago, I had open kidney surgery. After being bedridden for most of my three and a half week hospital stay, that final week felt like a triumph.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d graduated from assisted walking to making it down the hospital floor and back on my own. By discharge day, I was walking the entire floor independently. I felt confident. Ready to get back to normal life.</p>\n<p>That confidence lasted exactly ten meters outside the hospital.</p>\n<p>Ten meters from my front door, I needed a thirty-second break. Just ten meters. The same distance I&rsquo;d been covering easily in the hospital corridors suddenly felt impossible. After feeling so capable walking those hospital floors, I felt like I&rsquo;d run a marathon.</p>\n<p>By the end of that first day home, I&rsquo;d managed maybe thirty or forty meters total before admitting complete defeat. The difference between hospital walking and real-world walking hit me like a wall.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what I didn&rsquo;t understand then. Hospital floors are designed for recovery. They&rsquo;re flat, climate-controlled, with handrails and places to rest every few meters. The real world has curbs, uneven pavement, weather, and distances that actually matter.

				"content_text": "Eight weeks ago, I had open kidney surgery. After being bedridden for most of my three and a half week hospital stay, that final week felt like a triumph.\n\nI'd graduated from assisted walking to making it down the hospital floor and back on my own. By discharge day, I was walking the entire floor independently. I felt confident. Ready to get back to normal life.\n\nThat confidence lasted exactly ten meters outside the hospital.\n\nTen meters from my front door, I needed a thirty-second break. Just ten meters. The same distance I'd been covering easily in the hospital corridors suddenly felt impossible. After feeling so capable walking those hospital floors, I felt like I'd run a marathon.\n\nBy the end of that first day home, I'd managed maybe thirty or forty meters total before admitting complete defeat. The difference between hospital walking and real-world walking hit me like a wall.\n\nHere's what I didn't understand then. Hospital floors are designed for recovery. They're flat, climate-controlled, with handrails and places to rest every few meters. The real world has curbs, uneven pavement, weather, and distances that actually matter. Walking a hospital corridor doesn't prepare you for walking to your mailbox.\n\nThe medical reality is pretty straightforward, but no one really prepares you for the psychological whiplash. After weeks of bed rest followed by successful hospital walking, you think you're ready. Then you discover that three and a half weeks of lying still, even with that final week of corridor walking, has fundamentally changed what your body can handle.\n\nThose first few days home were a study in humility I never wanted to take.

Week seven, I made it to the local park and back.\n\nYesterday, I walked 1.5 kilometers in thirty minutes without stopping once. I held a conversation the entire time. Eight weeks after surgery, four and a half weeks after that humbling ten-meter reality check.\n\nWhat strikes me most isn't just the physical progress. It's how hospital walking creates false confidence that real-world recovery quickly corrects. Before surgery, walking was just transportation.

				"content_text": "I spent four hours yesterday watching YouTube videos about productivity.\n\nThe irony wasn't lost on me. There I was, consuming content about being productive instead of actually being productive. But here's the thing - I wasn't just being lazy. I was overwhelmed.\n\nI have too many interests that all matter to me. I love to code. There's something magical about writing text and making computers do things. I'm supposed to be working on an iPadOS app for my wife. \n\nI love cooking, which means meal planning and grocery shopping - two huge time sucks. \n\nI like working out, though I rarely do it anymore. \n\nRoleplaying games fascinate me. I want to set up the next adventure for friends. \n\nMy wife has her own projects that need my support. Then there's my reading backlog - books, stories, technical manuals.\n\nOh, and I spend twelve hours a week getting dialysis.\n\n## The Multi-Interest Trap\n\nMost productivity advice assumes your interests are frivolous. \"Just eliminate the time-wasters,\" they say. \"Focus on what matters.\"\n\nBut what if everything matters?\n\nCoding isn't just a hobby - it's creative problem-solving that feeds my soul. Cooking isn't just sustenance - it's how I care for my family. RPGs aren't escapism - they're collaborative storytelling that connects me with friends. Reading isn't procrastination - it's how I learn and grow.\n\nThe problem isn't having meaningless hobbies. The problem is having too many meaningful ones.\n\nTraditional productivity gurus don't account for this. They assume you're scrolling TikTok for hours, not trying to choose between legitimate creative pursuits. When all your interests have value, choosing becomes paralyzing.\n\n## The Chronic Illness Factor\n\nThen there's the reality most productivity advice ignores completely: chronic illness.\n\nI spend four hours, three days a week, lying in a bed with needles in my left arm. I can't move that arm. I can't use both hands. I'm physically constrained in ways that make traditional \"hustle culture\" advice feel like a cruel joke.\n\nMy energy fluctuates wildly. Some afternoons after dialysis, I feel energetic. Other days, I'm completely drained. The days between treatments are usually my most productive, but that's only four days a week at full capacity.\n\nMost productivity experts have never had to plan their creative work around medical treatments. They've never had to factor in recovery time or energy management. Their advice assumes consistent daily energy levels that simply don't exist for people like me.\n\n## The Consumption Trap\n\nThis is where YouTube becomes dangerous.\n\nWhen you're tired, when you're overwhelmed by choices, when you're physically limited, consumption becomes the path of least resistance. Watching someone else code feels productive without requiring the energy that actual coding demands. Food videos scratch the cooking itch without the meal planning overhead.\n\nI recently watched a video that hit hard (see [The Habit that forces your brain to stop consuming](https://youtu.be/R4MInIP2c-A?si=rW29vhDlEfG-JAx7)). The creator talked about how our brains crave novelty and dopamine, and social media provides artificial hits of both.

What happens when you have the drive to create but not always the energy or physical capacity?\n\n## Adapted Strategies\n\nThe solution isn't to eliminate interests or ignore physical limitations. It's to work smarter with the energy and time you actually have.\n\n**Work with your energy patterns, not against them.** My most productive days are the in-between days. Instead of feeling guilty about low-energy days, I've started planning for them.

Well, sort of.</p>\n<p>They use AI to transform old paintings and descriptions into photorealistic faces. Suddenly, historical figures aren&rsquo;t just names in textbooks. They&rsquo;re people. Real people with eyes that seem to look right at you.</p>\n<p>The channel creates videos that reimagine everyone from Geronimo to Anastasia Romanov. Each face tells a story. Each image makes history feel closer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-magic-behind-the-screen\">The Magic Behind the Screen</h2>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works. The AI analyzes everything available about a historical figure. Paintings, sketches, written descriptions. Even details about their ethnicity and the time period.</p>\n<p>Then it creates what they probably looked like. Not cartoon versions. Not idealized portraits. Just people.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s like time travel without the paradoxes.</p>\n<p>The technology adds subtle details too. Skin texture, natural lighting, realistic hair. These aren&rsquo;t Instagram filters. This is serious reconstruction work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-this-is-a-brilliant-use-of-ai\">Why This is a Brilliant Use of AI</h2>\n<p>Most AI applications feel cold. This one creates connection.</p>\n<p>Think about it. We learn history through dusty portraits and formal paintings. Everyone looks stern. Everyone looks distant. No wonder kids find history boring.</p>\n<p>But show them what Cleopatra might have really looked like? Now you&rsquo;ve got their attention.</p>\n<p>This democratizes history in ways textbooks never could. You don&rsquo;t need a PhD to feel connected to these figures. You just need eyes and curiosity.</p>\n<p>It also preserves cultural memory differently. Not through static images. Through faces that feel alive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hit-series-that-changed-everything\">Hit Series That Changed Everything</h2>\n<p>Their &ldquo;20 Historical Icons Brought Back to Life&rdquo; series went viral. For good reason.</p>\n<p>Each episode features multiple historical figures. George Washington looks less like a dollar bill and more like your stern grandfather. Anastasia Romanov becomes a real teenager, not just a tragic legend.</p>\n<p>Marie Curie? She looks brilliant and tired. Exactly how you&rsquo;d expect someone who discovered radium to look.</p>\n<p>Geronimo stares back with intensity that no painting captured. You understand why he was such a formidable leader.</p>\n<p>These aren&rsquo;t just pictures. They&rsquo;re windows into real lives.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future-of-learning-history\">The Future of Learning History</h2>\n<p>This is what good AI looks like. It doesn&rsquo;t replace human connection. It creates it.</p>\n<p>Imagine history classes using this technology. Students could &ldquo;meet&rdquo; the people they&rsquo;re studying. The American Revolution becomes less abstract when you can see Washington&rsquo;s actual face.</p>\n<p>Teachers could show that historical figures were just people. They had bad hair days. They had worry lines. They looked tired sometimes.</p>\n<p>It changes everything about how we relate to the past.</p>\n<h2 id=\"some-final-thoughts\">Some Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Sure, these reconstructions aren&rsquo;t perfect. We can&rsquo;t know exactly what these people looked like. But that&rsquo;s not really the point.</p>\n<p>The point is connection. The point is making history human again.</p>\n<p>When you see Cleopatra as a real person, not just an Elizabeth Taylor movie, something shifts. History stops being about dates and starts being about people.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the real magic here. Not the AI technology itself. But what it helps us see.</p>\n<p>Dead people were once alive. They had faces. They had expressions. They were just like us.</p>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what makes <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@relaxhistoryai?si=eBPLAHoD6LA1_cy1\">Relax History AI</a> such a great use of artificial intelligence.

Paintings, sketches, written descriptions. Even details about their ethnicity and the time period.\n\nThen it creates what they probably looked like. Not cartoon versions. Not idealized portraits. Just people.\n\nIt's like time travel without the paradoxes.\n\nThe technology adds subtle details too. Skin texture, natural lighting, realistic hair. These aren't Instagram filters. This is serious reconstruction work.\n\n## Why This is a Brilliant Use of AI\n\nMost AI applications feel cold. This one creates connection.\n\nThink about it. We learn history through dusty portraits and formal paintings. Everyone looks stern. Everyone looks distant. No wonder kids find history boring.\n\nBut show them what Cleopatra might have really looked like? Now you've got their attention.\n\nThis democratizes history in ways textbooks never could. You don't need a PhD to feel connected to these figures. You just need eyes and curiosity.\n\nIt also preserves cultural memory differently. Not through static images. Through faces that feel alive.\n\n## Hit Series That Changed Everything\n\nTheir \"20 Historical Icons Brought Back to Life\" series went viral. For good reason.\n\nEach episode features multiple historical figures. George Washington looks less like a dollar bill and more like your stern grandfather. Anastasia Romanov becomes a real teenager, not just a tragic legend.\n\nMarie Curie? She looks brilliant and tired. Exactly how you'd expect someone who discovered radium to look.\n\nGeronimo stares back with intensity that no painting captured. You understand why he was such a formidable leader.\n\nThese aren't just pictures. They're windows into real lives.\n\n## The Future of Learning History\n\nThis is what good AI looks like. It doesn't replace human connection. It creates it.\n\nImagine history classes using this technology. Students could \"meet\" the people they're studying. The American Revolution becomes less abstract when you can see Washington's actual face.\n\nTeachers could show that historical figures were just people. They had bad hair days. They had worry lines. They looked tired sometimes.\n\nIt changes everything about how we relate to the past.\n\n## Some Final Thoughts\n\nSure, these reconstructions aren't perfect. We can't know exactly what these people looked like. But that's not really the point.\n\nThe point is connection. The point is making history human again.\n\nWhen you see Cleopatra as a real person, not just an Elizabeth Taylor movie, something shifts. History stops being about dates and starts being about people.\n\nThat's the real magic here. Not the AI technology itself. But what it helps us see.\n\nDead people were once alive. They had faces. They had expressions. They were just like us.\n\nAnd that's exactly what makes [Relax History AI](https://youtube.com/@relaxhistoryai?si=eBPLAHoD6LA1_cy1) such a great use of artificial intelligence. It makes the artificial feel human.\n\n---\n\n*Have you checked out any of their videos yet? Which historical figure would you most like to see brought to life?*\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I thought I’d write down my current workflow setup since it has changed drastically since I last wrote about it. Not only am I exclusively working from home these days—due to health reasons—but I am also working in a very reduced capacity. This means I am mostly using my iPhone, iPad, and iMac for leisure.</p>\n<p>With that being said, here is what I use on a daily basis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keeping-up-with-the-joneses\">Keeping up with the Joneses</h2>\n<h3 id=\"microblog\">Micro.blog</h3>\n<p>I said goodbye to social media a while ago. While I was quite active on Twitter and even more so on App.net and Slack, I have since dropped all of these. There really isn&rsquo;t much point in spinning my wheels there.</p>\n<p>These days, I post to my own blog, which is syndicated to the Micro.blog timeline and also cross-posted to Mastodon. I&rsquo;m not active on Mastodon, but thanks to the Fediverse, any replies I receive on Mastodon should appear on my Micro.blog timeline.</p>\n<p>Posting to my blog is done via the Micro.blog app or website, which is very frictionless for the most part.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My <a href=\"https://micro.blog/AlexKucera\">Micro.blog Account</a></li>\n<li>My <a href=\"https://alexanderkucera.com\">website</a></li>\n<li>My Fediverse ID: <a href=\"@alex@alexanderkucera.com\">@alex@alexanderkucera.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"fiery-feeds-and-feedbin\">Fiery Feeds and FeedBin</h3>\n<p>For my daily news, I tend to watch the local news show <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@tagesschau?si=DNoE4UhebBbcOiOz\">Tagesthemen</a> while eating breakfast. This keeps me up to date on both local and global news and politics.</p>\n<p>For my tech news and other updates, I use <a href=\"https://feedbin.com/home\">Feedbin</a> to curate my feeds and <a href=\"https://voidstern.net/fiery-feeds\">Fiery Feeds</a> for reading them. Fiery Feeds has a few nice intelligent curation options, like Hot Links or Long and Short articles, that make it easy to catch up on too many RSS feeds every day. Yes, maybe I should subscribe to fewer feeds, but with Fiery Feeds, I really don’t have to.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overcast\">Overcast</h3>\n<p>Every couple of years, I switch podcast apps. I used to be an avid user of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/pocket-casts-podcast-player/id414834813\">Pocket Casts</a>, and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241\">Castro</a> was my favorite player for years. These days, I am back with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/overcast/id888422857\">Overcast</a>. I don’t have any special feelings for it; it works well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"youtube\">YouTube</h3>\n<p>Sadly, I am a sucker for YouTube videos. I do not browse the auto-suggestions much, but I have way too many subscriptions. At the moment, my „Watch Later“ queue contains 24 items, most of which are in the 20-30 minute range. However, there are a few videos that are 1.5-3 hours long that I haven’t gotten around to watching.</p>\n<h3 id=\"discord\">Discord</h3>\n<p>While I don’t engage much on Discord, I follow a few servers to get news announcements and participate in one or two in-person chats. The days when I was active daily for several hours on Slack and Discord are long gone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"health-related\">Health related</h2>\n<h3 id=\"macrofactor\">MacroFactor</h3>\n<p>I recently started using <a href=\"https://macrofactorapp.com/\">MacroFactor</a> to track my food and water intake. I have been on and off the food-tracking wagon in the past; usually, I track for a week or two before stopping again. The apps I have used in the past, like Lifesum and MyFitnessPal, are all nice and work reasonably well with tracking EU foods. However, they all miss a crucial element: they don’t adapt to one’s personal habits; they simply track food.</p>\n<p>MacroFactor, on the other hand, adapts to your eating habits, providing you with tailored goals and occasionally coaching you on what you can improve or change. It simply clicks with me much more than all the other apps I have tried.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rp-hypertrophy\">RP Hypertrophy</h3>\n<p>About a year ago, I finally accepted that I needed to build some strength to get my life back. Due to severe health-related issues, I pretty much stopped moving around 2016. I didn’t blow up, but I lost nearly all my muscle. Moving around the house became a chore at times. Combined with some serious joint inflammation, this kept me sedentary.</p>\n<p>No more. I started slowly to build muscle again. At first, I went too quickly, which resulted in weeks of not being able to work out due to inflamed joints. However, in combination with MacroFactor, I have been able to manage my food intake in a way that reduces inflammation while providing enough protein and energy to rebuild my strength.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://rpstrength.com/pages/hypertrophy-app\">RP Hypertrophy</a> app has been my steadfast companion. There are other exercise apps out there—some cheaper, some more expensive, and some even free—but none of them resonate with me like the RP Hypertrophy app does. The way it allows me to quickly set up a training plan is unparalleled. It also helps me with my progression by analyzing my workout volume. Great! One less thing to think about.</p>\n<p>RP Strength also has a <a href=\"https://rpstrength.com/pages/diet-coach-app\">Diet Coach</a> app, but for me, MacroFactor works better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writing\">Writing</h2>\n<h3 id=\"paper\">Paper</h3>\n<p>I recently stumbled across <a href=\"https://papereditor.app\">Paper</a> as a writing tool, and I really, really like it. I haven’t quite found the justification to pay for it yet. It comes with a hefty price tag in my region (the developer consciously charges more in richer regions of the world). However, I might consider it in the future, depending on whether I start writing professionally again in the coming months. For now, I’m going the cheapskate route and clicking away the nag screens that pop up now and again. Sorry, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_mihhail\">Mihhail</a>!</p>\n<h3 id=\"textastic\">Textastic</h3>\n<p>I don’t use <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/textastic-code-editor/id1049254261\">Textastic</a> for actual writing, but it is a great general text editor if I need to edit something from my iCloud, modify a file on my server, or whip up a quick Python script or other scripts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"airmail\">AirMail</h3>\n<p>My email client of choice is <a href=\"https://airmailapp.com\">AirMail</a>. There’s not much to say about it, really. It works for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"apps-by-readdle\">Apps by Readdle</h2>\n<p>I use several apps from the Ukrainian developer <a href=\"https://readdle.com/\">Readdle</a>. They tend to deliver a polished experience, and their support is excellent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"calendars\">Calendars</h3>\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://readdle.com/calendars\">calendar solution</a> is top-notch. It supports natural language event creation, the UI is nice, and it works better for me than the native Calendar app on iOS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scanner\">Scanner</h3>\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://readdle.com/scannerpro\">document scanner</a> works in a very no-nonsense way. It offers great support for de-skewing and straightening out your wonky document photos. It provides automatic OCR and document naming, and you can create workflows—something I haven’t taken advantage of yet, as my needs aren’t that complex.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pdf-expert\">PDF Expert</h3>\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://pdfexpert.com\">PDF reader</a> works great. You can edit and annotate PDFs.

				"content_text": "I thought I’d write down my current workflow setup since it has changed drastically since I last wrote about it. Not only am I exclusively working from home these days—due to health reasons—but I am also working in a very reduced capacity. This means I am mostly using my iPhone, iPad, and iMac for leisure.\n\nWith that being said, here is what I use on a daily basis.\n\n## Keeping up with the Joneses\n\n### Micro.blog\n\nI said goodbye to social media a while ago. While I was quite active on Twitter and even more so on App.net and Slack, I have since dropped all of these. There really isn't much point in spinning my wheels there.\n\nThese days, I post to my own blog, which is syndicated to the Micro.blog timeline and also cross-posted to Mastodon. I'm not active on Mastodon, but thanks to the Fediverse, any replies I receive on Mastodon should appear on my Micro.blog timeline.\n\nPosting to my blog is done via the Micro.blog app or website, which is very frictionless for the most part.\n\n- My [Micro.blog Account](https://micro.blog/AlexKucera)\n- My [website](https://alexanderkucera.com)\n- My Fediverse ID: [@alex@alexanderkucera.com](@alex@alexanderkucera.com)\n\n### Fiery Feeds and FeedBin\n\nFor my daily news, I tend to watch the local news show [Tagesthemen](https://youtube.com/@tagesschau?si=DNoE4UhebBbcOiOz) while eating breakfast. This keeps me up to date on both local and global news and politics.\n\nFor my tech news and other updates, I use [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/home) to curate my feeds and [Fiery Feeds](https://voidstern.net/fiery-feeds) for reading them. Fiery Feeds has a few nice intelligent curation options, like Hot Links or Long and Short articles, that make it easy to catch up on too many RSS feeds every day. Yes, maybe I should subscribe to fewer feeds, but with Fiery Feeds, I really don’t have to.\n\n### Overcast\n\nEvery couple of years, I switch podcast apps. I used to be an avid user of [Pocket Casts](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/pocket-casts-podcast-player/id414834813), and [Castro](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241) was my favorite player for years. These days, I am back with [Overcast](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/overcast/id888422857). I don’t have any special feelings for it; it works well.\n\n### YouTube\n\nSadly, I am a sucker for YouTube videos. I do not browse the auto-suggestions much, but I have way too many subscriptions. At the moment, my „Watch Later“ queue contains 24 items, most of which are in the 20-30 minute range. However, there are a few videos that are 1.5-3 hours long that I haven’t gotten around to watching.\n\n### Discord\n\nWhile I don’t engage much on Discord, I follow a few servers to get news announcements and participate in one or two in-person chats. The days when I was active daily for several hours on Slack and Discord are long gone.\n\n## Health related\n\n### MacroFactor\n\nI recently started using [MacroFactor](https://macrofactorapp.com/) to track my food and water intake. I have been on and off the food-tracking wagon in the past; usually, I track for a week or two before stopping again. The apps I have used in the past, like Lifesum and MyFitnessPal, are all nice and work reasonably well with tracking EU foods. However, they all miss a crucial element: they don’t adapt to one’s personal habits; they simply track food.\n\nMacroFactor, on the other hand, adapts to your eating habits, providing you with tailored goals and occasionally coaching you on what you can improve or change. It simply clicks with me much more than all the other apps I have tried.\n\n### RP Hypertrophy\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally accepted that I needed to build some strength to get my life back. Due to severe health-related issues, I pretty much stopped moving around 2016. I didn’t blow up, but I lost nearly all my muscle. Moving around the house became a chore at times. Combined with some serious joint inflammation, this kept me sedentary.\n\nNo more. I started slowly to build muscle again. At first, I went too quickly, which resulted in weeks of not being able to work out due to inflamed joints. However, in combination with MacroFactor, I have been able to manage my food intake in a way that reduces inflammation while providing enough protein and energy to rebuild my strength.\n\nThe [RP Hypertrophy](https://rpstrength.com/pages/hypertrophy-app) app has been my steadfast companion. There are other exercise apps out there—some cheaper, some more expensive, and some even free—but none of them resonate with me like the RP Hypertrophy app does. The way it allows me to quickly set up a training plan is unparalleled. It also helps me with my progression by analyzing my workout volume. Great! One less thing to think about.\n\nRP Strength also has a [Diet Coach](https://rpstrength.com/pages/diet-coach-app) app, but for me, MacroFactor works better.\n\n## Writing\n\n### Paper\n\nI recently stumbled across [Paper](https://papereditor.app) as a writing tool, and I really, really like it. I haven’t quite found the justification to pay for it yet. It comes with a hefty price tag in my region (the developer consciously charges more in richer regions of the world). However, I might consider it in the future, depending on whether I start writing professionally again in the coming months. For now, I’m going the cheapskate route and clicking away the nag screens that pop up now and again. Sorry, [Mihhail](https://twitter.com/_mihhail)!\n\n### Textastic\n\nI don’t use [Textastic](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/textastic-code-editor/id1049254261) for actual writing, but it is a great general text editor if I need to edit something from my iCloud, modify a file on my server, or whip up a quick Python script or other scripts. \n\n### AirMail\n\nMy email client of choice is [AirMail](https://airmailapp.com). There’s not much to say about it, really. It works for me.\n\n## Apps by Readdle\n\nI use several apps from the Ukrainian developer [Readdle](https://readdle.com/). They tend to deliver a polished experience, and their support is excellent.\n\n### Calendars\n\nTheir [calendar solution](https://readdle.com/calendars) is top-notch. It supports natural language event creation, the UI is nice, and it works better for me than the native Calendar app on iOS.\n\n### Scanner\n\nTheir [document scanner](https://readdle.com/scannerpro) works in a very no-nonsense way. It offers great support for de-skewing and straightening out your wonky document photos. It provides automatic OCR and document naming, and you can create workflows—something I haven’t taken advantage of yet, as my needs aren’t that complex.\n\n### PDF Expert\n\nTheir [PDF reader](https://pdfexpert.com) works great. You can edit and annotate PDFs. Sadly, there is no OCR on iOS or iPadOS yet, but I am told it’s coming.\n\n## Strongbox\n\nI used to be a strong [1Password](https://1password.com/) supporter. I bought it way back when I got my first iPhone—an iPhone 4. Since then, I have bought several updates, and when they switched to a subscription model, I purchased the family plan for—I think—two years.\n\nThen I read a thread on Micro.blog where someone talked about [Strongbox](https://strongboxsafe.com/). I checked it out, installed it, and took advantage of their very generous three-month trial. After a week or so of use, they had won me over, and I happily paid for their lifetime license after the trial period was over.\n\nGranted, using Strongbox is a little bit more complicated and less streamlined than using 1Password, but their lifetime license costs what I used to pay for 1Password in a year. There is simply no comparison when it comes to value per euro.\n\n## AI\n\n### Perplexity\n\nI use [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai) for searching most of the time instead of doing a Google or DuckDuckGo search. I enjoy getting nicely written summarized results, and if I want to dig deeper, I can simply open the sources Perplexity found for a given topic. I haven’t found any instances where the AI hallucinated an answer, but there have been a few occasions where the suggested follow-up questions were just nonsense.\n\n### TypingMind\n\n[TypingMind](https://www.typingmind.com) is a great ChatGPT interface that allows me to use most ChatGPT  features without shelling out over $20 a month. It connects via the ChatGPT API, which results in much more reasonable costs. I got myself a premium license and haven’t looked back since.\n\n### MidJourney\n\nGenerative Imaging. Some people loathe it; I personally love it. [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com) is great for quickly generating dozens of variations on an idea, especially since they enabled generation via the website instead of in a Discord chat. We have used it to rapidly create initial drafts and, yes, even final designs for projects, both professional and private.\n\n## Graphics\n\n### Affinity Designer 2\n\nSince I have mostly stepped back from work, we primarily focus on occasional graphic design for local projects, such as flyers, postcards, roll-up flags, and the like.\n\n[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/) is unbeatable in terms of price and the value it offers for this purpose. Additionally, we can use it on the iPad for initial mockups and then continue working on the same file on the Mac. Brilliant!\n\n### Affinity Photo 2\n\nIt’s pixel-related brother, [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/photo/), while not as intuitive and powerful as Photoshop, is still nevertheless our main go-to when it comes to editing images. Plus, it works well together with Designer and also offers the same iPad-to-Mac and back workflow.\n\n### QR Factory\n\nSince we switched to a more graphic design-based workflow, we regularly need to create QR codes. While there are many online and free generators available, [QR Factory](https://www.tunabellysoftware.com/qrfactory/) offers a comprehensive suite of QR options in one package. I wouldn’t consider using any other option anymore.\n\n### Nuke\n\nFoundry’s [Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke-family) is my main workhorse for paid work. Although I don’t do as much as I once did, I am still very happy to pay for an Indie license when the occasional project comes in. Nuke remains the gold standard for compositing.\n\n### Modo\n\nSimilarly, when I need to do some 3D work, I use my trusty copy of Foundry’s [modo](https://www.foundry.com/products/modo). It still gets me everywhere I need to go—though these days, that isn’t very far.\n\n## Outbank\n\nFor banking in Germany, this is the way to go. [Outbank](https://outbankapp.com) has the best banking support of any app I’ve tried in the past. The developers had some negative press a couple of years ago related to pricing, subscriptions, and a completely revamped UI design, but I think they have recovered well from that.\n\nFor my money, this is the best way to keep track of your money, at least for European/German users.\n\n## Etsy and Printful\n\nI recently discovered [Printful](www.printful.com/de/give-5-get-5/FO7BEA), and it got me interested enough to open our own little [Etsy store](https://bdscribblewear.etsy.com) with designs from the cutting room floor. I mean, why let perfectly good doodles and scribbles go to waste?“\n\n## IT\n\n### FE File Explorer\n\n[FE File Explorer](https://www.skyjos.com/fileexplorer/) is my go-to app when the Files app on iOS won’t suffice. It is also a great FTP client and integrates nicely with our online workflow.\n\n### ShellFish\n\n[ShellFish](https://secureshellfish.app) is my preferred SSH client. I have tried a few others in the past, but ShellFish has really stuck with me. It also integrates nicely with Files.app.\n",

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://parfene.com/\">Nick Parfene</a> over in the Indie Microblogging Slack asked me to write about my posting workflow and since I haven’t written about how I blog for <a href=\"http://blog.alexanderkucera.com/articles/blogging_workflow_again\">over three years</a> it could do with an update.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-change\">Why change?</h2>\n<p>First, why change the previous workflow? I got confused. Simple as that. My blogging schedule is erratic at best. And the old run and gun style workflow, while working, always left me scratching my head when I hadn’t touched it for a few months. I know, months is a sad amount of idle time between posts. But it is what it is.</p>\n<p>So to keep myself in the loop what happened to my blog I decided to adopt Git for keeping a publishing history. Not only does it allow me to tinker with the blog’s templates and CSS without messing up, it also serves as a nice automatic history what I did when and for what reason. I just need to read the commit log to job my memory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-in-between-workflow\">The in-between workflow</h2>\n<p>The last workflow I wrote about three years ago relied on a desktop machine running. While I have a server machine running 24/7 I did experience too many hiccups with that approach to feel reliable. So I switched it to a two pronged process that worked pretty well. On the go I was posting with Workflow and Transmit and on the desktop I was using Hazel with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->custom Python script<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>This tended to work pretty well.

				"content_text": "[Nick Parfene](http://parfene.com/) over in the Indie Microblogging Slack asked me to write about my posting workflow and since I haven’t written about how I blog for [over three years](http://blog.alexanderkucera.com/articles/blogging_workflow_again) it could do with an update.\n\n## Why change?\nFirst, why change the previous workflow? I got confused. Simple as that. My blogging schedule is erratic at best. And the old run and gun style workflow, while working, always left me scratching my head when I hadn’t touched it for a few months. I know, months is a sad amount of idle time between posts. But it is what it is.\n\nSo to keep myself in the loop what happened to my blog I decided to adopt Git for keeping a publishing history. Not only does it allow me to tinker with the blog’s templates and CSS without messing up, it also serves as a nice automatic history what I did when and for what reason. I just need to read the commit log to job my memory.\n\n## The in-between workflow\nThe last workflow I wrote about three years ago relied on a desktop machine running. While I have a server machine running 24/7 I did experience too many hiccups with that approach to feel reliable. So I switched it to a two pronged process that worked pretty well. On the go I was posting with Workflow and Transmit and on the desktop I was using Hazel with a <a href=\"https://alexanderkucera.com/uploads/2024/blog-post-transform.zip\">custom Python script</a>. \n\nThis tended to work pretty well. Especially the on the go version. Write stuff in whatever text editor suits you best (I use [Ulysses](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/de/app/ulysses/id950335311?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%253D4)), send over to [Workflow](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?) for [processing](https://workflow.is/workflows/b0364be085534bb8b94003de824f8d4d) and upload to blog with [Transmit](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/transmit-ios/id917432930?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%253D4). For images the procedure is similar only I use [ImageOptim](https://workflow.is/workflows/42d6d670bbd940148a8e3c945682bc15) or [Kraken](https://workflow.is/workflows/a70ddd60f996477385a2d5d2d934fa60) for image optimization before uploading.

From the basics of RSL (Renderman Shading Language) with its empirical shading to RSL 2.0 and the first steps in physically plausible shading to the new <a href=\"http://www.fxguide.com/featured/rendermanris-and-the-start-of-next-25-years/\">RIS</a> path tracing engine that allows physically accurate image creation.</p>\n<p>We started with RSL 1.2, which basically was state of the art in big budget productions up to 2005. It had the hallmarks of traditional computer graphics: light sources without any size or falloff (in fact, ILM usually didn&rsquo;t use falloff on lights at all even though an option for realistic light falloff existed) and of course idealized materials that had lots of dials for creative control without any regards to physically accuracy or energy conservation. One could easily create a surface that was brighter then any of the lights hitting it for example.</p>\n<p>With that creative freedom comes a lot of complexity though to get something that can be considered &ldquo;correct&rdquo; when it comes to realism, a required goalpost when you want to integrate your renderings into filmed footage.</p>\n<p>To get to an acceptable result quicker and with less complications, Pixar started to implement physically plausible rendering which was first used in Iron Man and later in Monster University to great effect.

Mainly it slowed down in complex raytracing setups due to Ray Hit Shading taking a lot of time and the memory usage exploded with complex scenes. This lead Pixar to develop a path tracing approach and a new render engine called RIS. For an in depth overview see last year&rsquo;s article on <a href=\"http://www.fxguide.com/featured/rendermanris-and-the-start-of-next-25-years/\">RIS</a>.</p>\n<p>RIS allows for even simpler controls, while rendering more accurately, faster and with less memory then the RSL approach. Shaders are now fully integrated but very modular, which allows for easy debugging or switching out whole block for quickly getting different results.</p>\n<p><em>Finding Dory</em>, which is currently in production at Pixar, is the first movie that is using RIS. In fact, Dory is the first use of what Christophe calls the RUKUS pipeline: RIS, <a href=\"http://graphics.pixar.com/usd/\">USD</a> a new interchange format developed at Pixar similar to Alembic and Katana. Christophe joked that he still hasn&rsquo;t figured out what U and S stand for.</p>\n<p>Since RIS has the ability to do progressive rendering, the look development and final rendering has accelerated quite a bit. An artist can set up a complex shot, put it on the farm and then &ldquo;check in&rdquo; after say 20 minutes and get a good idea what the final images are going to look like as the whole image is already visible, albeit very noisy. Then they can just let it &ldquo;cook&rdquo; on the farm until an acceptable noise level is reached. The remaining noise residue is being filtered away as a last step. A technology that Pixar was able to use from Hyperion, Disney&rsquo;s new Path Tracing engine and it will be part of the public Renderman release in the future.</p>\n<p>This means there is less human (expensive) time needed to set up a shot as there is much less trial and error. Artist always have a really good idea of what the final result is going to look like.</p>\n<p>Sadly, Christophe wasn&rsquo;t able to show us final imagery of Dory, as production isn&rsquo;t that far along yet, but we did see a few shots of Dory and Nemo in their new look and they do look much improved from their old selves. We saw them being shaded, lit and look dev&rsquo;ed in realtime in Katana and the experience looked very smooth and seamless.</p>\n",

In fact, Dory is the first use of what Christophe calls the RUKUS pipeline: RIS, [USD](http://graphics.pixar.com/usd/) a new interchange format developed at Pixar similar to Alembic and Katana. Christophe joked that he still hasn't figured out what U and S stand for.\n\nSince RIS has the ability to do progressive rendering, the look development and final rendering has accelerated quite a bit. An artist can set up a complex shot, put it on the farm and then \"check in\" after say 20 minutes and get a good idea what the final images are going to look like as the whole image is already visible, albeit very noisy. Then they can just let it \"cook\" on the farm until an acceptable noise level is reached. The remaining noise residue is being filtered away as a last step. A technology that Pixar was able to use from Hyperion, Disney's new Path Tracing engine and it will be part of the public Renderman release in the future.\n\nThis means there is less human (expensive) time needed to set up a shot as there is much less trial and error. Artist always have a really good idea of what the final result is going to look like.\n\nSadly, Christophe wasn't able to show us final imagery of Dory, as production isn't that far along yet, but we did see a few shots of Dory and Nemo in their new look and they do look much improved from their old selves. We saw them being shaded, lit and look dev'ed in realtime in Katana and the experience looked very smooth and seamless.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In the spirit of app recommendation lists that keep popping up everywhere I decided to make my own. I do have a lot of iOS apps. In fact, I went a little overboard in 2012 and the first half of 2013. So much so that after I added up the amount of money I spent on app purchases, I went on a very strict app feast for the rest of 2013.</p>\n<p>Anyway, my point is that I have tried a lot of apps and a couple stuck leading to the top apps I use today. Each category is in order of importance to my way of working. Well more or less. Halfway through I wasn&rsquo;t able to decide on the proper order, so higher up is generally more important to me, but it&rsquo;s a sliding scale the further down you get.</p>\n<h2 id=\"quick-links\">Quick Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#internet\">Internet Apps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#productivity\">Productivity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#media\">Media</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#shopping\">Shopping</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"internet\">Internet Apps</h2>\n<p>While Internet is a pretty broad term, I use it to designate apps that are used to interact with the online world.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/felix-iphone-edition/id562447652?mt=8\">Felix</a>\nWithout doubt still my favorite <a href=\"http://app.net\">App.net</a> client. It has gotten pretty slow on my iPhone 4, but I still keep coming back to it every day. Felix definitely is a top contender to the &ldquo;most used app&rdquo; spot.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunstroke/id488564806?mt=8\">Sunstroke</a>\nFor my news reading I am using a <a href=\"http://feedafever.com/\">Fever</a> install on my server. Sunstroke is without a doubt the best way to access my Fever feeds on the iPhone and I have tried pretty much every Fever compatible iPhone client out there. It is not as versatile as <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8\">Mr. Reader</a> on the iPad for sharing out items, but from a pure reading perspective I have yet to find a better app.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-5-for-twitter/id580311103?mt=8\">Twitteriffic</a></p>\n<p>I hardly use <a href=\"https://twitter.com\">Twitter</a> anymore these days. <a href=\"http://app.net\">App.net</a> has almost completely replaced the service with the bird for me. However, a lot of my colleagues still use it and I need a way to occasionally respond to DMs and mentions. Twitteriffic is a beautiful and more then adequate Twitter client for this job.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articles/id364881979?mt=8\">Articles</a></p>\n<p>For my <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a> research I prefer to use a dedicated client like Articles. This is one area where I grabbed the client that looked best for me way back when I got my first iPhone and I just never tried another one. So there might be better Wikipedia clients out there, but Articles suits me just fine.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dict.cc-dictionary/id327732352?mt=8\">dict.cc</a></p>\n<p>While my English is reasonably good, I do need to look up words once in a while. I found dict.cc a pretty good dictionary. Plus it is an offline dictionary, which is still something I rely on occasionally in spots with bad reception.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weatherpro/id294631159?mt=8\">WeatherPro</a></p>\n<p>I usually check the weather by looking out the window—now there&rsquo;s a revolutionary idea! But when I need to look up the weather at a travel destination or to check a forecast for the upcoming week WeatherPro has proven to be the most reliable app for Germany and Europe in general. And it has nice detailed statistical infos and weather radar imagery. Not that I could make heads or tails of those, but they look nice.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outbank/id585564091?mt=8\">Outbank</a></p>\n<p>For German bank accounts there is nothing better then Outbank. It is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and it actually works with a wide array of banks. While I don&rsquo;t check my accounts daily, Outbank is certainly the cornerstone of my own digital accounting and that of our business.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screens-vnc-access-your-computer/id655890150?mt=8\">Screens VNC</a></p>\n<p>Another one of these &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use often, but critical when I do&rdquo; apps. Screens allows me to quickly fix things on our server even when I am hundreds of kilometers away from home. Together with Screens Connect, its desktop counterpart, setup is a breeze and I don&rsquo;t have to trouble myself with ports and SSL, etc. It just works.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pushpin-for-pinboard/id548052590?mt=8\">Pushpin</a></p>\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://pinboard.in\">Pinboard</a> for everything bookmarking related, including keeping a downloadable archive of the bookmark, meaning if the page you bookmarked goes offline, you&rsquo;ll still be able to see the archived copy indefinitely.</p>\n<p>And a big feature for me is that I use Pinboard as Instapaper replacement. Pushpin is the client that helps me achieve that last part. Right now it is a basic way to browse my bookmarks and catch up on my unread items. However, there is a feature in the works that will make my goal of using Pinboard and Instapaper replacement complete: Offline reading. I don&rsquo;t know when exactly it is coming, but I was assured it is coming and when the day comes it will be glorious. Or so I hope…</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8\">Dropbox</a>{#dropbox}</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t use the app that often, but it is very comforting to know that I have the option. Getting at anything in my Dropbox within a matter of seconds is truly convenient.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/facetime/\">FaceTime</a></p>\n<p>Skype can suck it. Especially since Microsoft took over and ruined the app even more. &lsquo;Nuff said.</p>\n<p>##Productivity {#productiviy}</p>\n<p>Productivity is such a loaded word that I try to avoid it. In this case I really am referring to apps that allow me to do work or to keep track of stuff.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8\">1Password</a></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to survive without 1Password. I&rsquo;d have to use the same password everywhere or juggle paper lists or something. Madness would ensue pretty quickly I am sure.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, AgileBits has me covered in the insanity department. 1Password is the first app I install on any machine. And since it syncs via Dropbox I can access my password library <a href=\"http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/1passwordanywhere.html\">even when I am on a random computer with Internet access</a>.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/begin-your-daily-to-do-list/id687455038?mt=8\">Begin</a></p>\n<p>Great little to do list app. Simple and very bare bones. Just what I need. I also have Omnifocus, but rarely use it. Begin I actually do use. It is a refreshing take on the old paradigm of creating lists to check off.</p>\n<p>###Mail.app</p>\n<p>What can I say? I rely on email and I find the default mail app to be very much sufficient. I have used Sparrow in the past, but with iOS 7 I switched back to the default app and haven&rsquo;t looked back.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8\">Drafts</a></p>\n<p>While I prefer to write on my iPad, I do use Drafts on the iPhone to sketch out quick ideas or as simple pasteboard. Sync with the Drafts for iPad app is instantaneous, so I can start a thought on my iPhone and continue it on my iPad in Drafts or <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8\">Editorial</a> without effort.</p>\n<p>I have set up a nice little array of custom actions in Drafts, which allows me to use it as a plain text journaling app or as a quick entry bucket for story ideas.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calendars-5-smart-calendar/id697927927?mt=8\">Calendars 5</a></p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/fantastical-2/id718043190?mt=8\">Fantastical</a> before Calendars, but as it turns out Calendars has the same natural language event creation, but a much nicer calendar interface. I don&rsquo;t use a calendar that often really, but it is always a pleasure to use Calendars 5 when I have to.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite-best-free-calculator/id300311831?mt=8\">PCcalc</a></p>\n<p>Powerful, quick, to the point. When I need to use a calculator this is the one I turn to. It allows me to be as simple or as complex in my calculations as I need to be and it can do so much more like convert units. Though for unit conversion I tend to use <a href=\"#vert\">Vert</a>.</p>\n<p>I linked to the free version above as that is already plenty powerful and if you so desire you can upgrade its functionality to suit your needs, which is exactly what I have done.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vert-2-unit-currency-converter/id691346630?mt=8\">Vert</a>{#vert}</p>\n<p>Vert is another one of those laser focused apps without any cruft, a concept that I seem to really gravitate to, don&rsquo;t I? Vert does exactly what it says on the tin. It converts a wide array of units and does so in a fast and efficient manner.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outliner/id284455726?mt=8\">CarbonFin Outliner</a></p>\n<p>Sometimes I need a list that is neither a todo list nor a full outline or mindmap. CarbonFin Outliner fills that niche nicely. It is very much alike the famous <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner\">OmniOutliner</a> condensed down for iPhone. It can be used as todo list app or as full blown outliner with comments and the likes. But it is clean enough that I can use it for my simple list making.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"http://www.navigon.com/portal/us/produkte/navigationssoftware/mobile_navigator_iphone_us.html\">Navigon</a></p>\n<p>The only turn by turn navigation I use. It is accurate, regularly updated with up to date map data and is generally nice to use.</p>\n<p>From the looks of it my global version of Navigon isn&rsquo;t offered any longer on the App Store. Instead there are several region based apps at a cheaper price.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/db-navigator/id343555245?mt=8\">DB Navigator</a></p>\n<p>The app of the German railway services. More of a nuisance then a must have, but it is better then juggling paper tickets.</p>\n<p>##Media {#media}</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-high-fidelity-podcasts/id723142770?mt=8\">Castro</a>\nThe new kid on the podcast client block has bedazzled me from the day it came out. Yes, it is very minimal in its feature set. However, I found that it actually offers all the features I need and not more. Before I was using <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/instacast-3/id577056377?mt=8\">Instacast</a> and lately <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8\">Downcast</a>, both great apps, but much too fiddly.</p>\n<p>I am so much happier with Castro and without feature bloat. Give it a try. You might like it.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audiobooks-from-audible/id379693831?mt=8\">Audible</a></p>\n<p>I cannot say enough good things about Audible. I love the way their service works. I love audiobooks. I love this app. That plus the fact that the support is simply awesome. Recently I found out that you can return two books a year within a year of purchase for a full refund without challenge from the staff. How awesome is that?</p>\n<p>I highly recommend a membership with them.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/naturespace-relax-meditate/id312618509?mt=8\">Naturespace</a></p>\n<p>Sometimes I need to switch off my brain completely or shut out the world. Naturespace is brilliant for that. It offers a great collection of high quality nature sounds that really transport you to the recorded location when you close your eyes.</p>\n<p>Listening to nature is a poor mans replacement to actually going outside, but it is worlds better then blasting my ears with music all day or using white noise to drown out environmental distractions.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera+/id329670577?mt=8\">Camera+</a></p>\n<p>My preferred quick and dirty image editor on the go. It has some nice filters and allows for some quick edits. And it allows me to share my pictures quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>There are other similar image editors like VSCO Cam (which I won&rsquo;t link to, because I despise it), but they all are too slow, ugly or have horrible filters in my opinion.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filterstorm-neue/id728479183?mt=8\">Filterstorm Neue</a></p>\n<p>Now this is a real work horse. Where Camera+ is my <em>Instagram</em> app, Filterstorm is my image editor on the go. It is pretty amazing what the developer has managed to pull of here. Quick, high quality editing on a tiny screen and excellent sharing options including direct FTP upload.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autostitch-panorama/id318944927?mt=8\">AutoStitch</a></p>\n<p>I do love panoramas. While the iOS panorama feature looks neat, my iPhone 4 is unable to use it. Also, I usually need more then a single horizontal strip of photos for my panoramas.</p>\n<p>AutoStitch is the best panorama app I have found. I can throw any amount of images at it snapped in all kinds of angles and it stitches them into a coherent panorama at a great quality and at up to 18 megapixels if I so desire.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camerasync/id406645727?mt=8\">CameraSync</a></p>\n<p>Once my images have been taken and edited, I upload them to <a href=\"#dropbox\">Dropbox</a>, my main storage location for all my pictures. CameraSync does so automatically in the background with a good selection of powerful options including the ability to prevent screenshots and videos from being uploaded if one so wishes.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unbound-for-dropbox/id586086921?mt=8\">Unbound</a></p>\n<p>After my images have uploaded with CameraSync I tend to delete them from my device. Unbound allows me to browse my complete image library from <a href=\"#dropbox\">Dropbox</a> in a nice interface.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-for/id406732590?mt=8\">Paprika</a></p>\n<p>A cooking app isn&rsquo;t exactly media, but it is the only category that semi-fit. Paprika is a great recipe app, because it is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and the recipes are synced between the devices. I can type in a new recipe when I am away for work and my wife can cook the dish at home a minute later or vice versa. Perfect.</p>\n<p>##Shopping {#shopping}</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-app/id297606951?mt=8\">Amazon</a></p>\n<p>I get <strong>everything</strong> from Amazon. The app is at the same time convenient and really not great to use. But it is better then the website at least from the iPhone, so I&rsquo;m using it.</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kickstarter-for-iphone/id596961532?mt=8\">Kickstarter</a></p>\n<p>Hi. My name is Alex and I have a Kickstarter addiction.</p>\n<p>Seriously though, I love browsing <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com\">Kickstarter</a> projects in the app for awesome projects, while at the same time hoping that there won&rsquo;t be, so I don&rsquo;t feel compelled to throw money out the window.</p>\n<p>I really should delete this app…</p>\n<p>###<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/delivery-status-touch-package/id290986013?mt=8\">Delivery Status Touch</a></p>\n<p>The best way to track where my shipments are at. Fullstop. Again a service that syncs across iOS and OS X. Those are really the most versatile, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>Pew, that was quite the list. While I don&rsquo;t use everything on this list daily and these are by far not the only apps I have installed on my iPhone, I would consider this group of apps essential for my daily work and play. I hope there were some nuggets in there for you <a href=\"https://alpha.app.net/hashtags/teamappdiction\">#teamappdiction</a> people. :)</p>\n",
				"content_text": "\nIn the spirit of app recommendation lists that keep popping up everywhere I decided to make my own. I do have a lot of iOS apps. In fact, I went a little overboard in 2012 and the first half of 2013. So much so that after I added up the amount of money I spent on app purchases, I went on a very strict app feast for the rest of 2013.\n\nAnyway, my point is that I have tried a lot of apps and a couple stuck leading to the top apps I use today. Each category is in order of importance to my way of working. Well more or less. Halfway through I wasn't able to decide on the proper order, so higher up is generally more important to me, but it's a sliding scale the further down you get.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n* [Internet Apps](#internet)\n* [Productivity](#productivity)\n* [Media](#media)\n* [Shopping](#shopping)\n\n## Internet Apps {#internet}\nWhile Internet is a pretty broad term, I use it to designate apps that are used to interact with the online world.\n\n###[Felix](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/felix-iphone-edition/id562447652?mt=8)\nWithout doubt still my favorite [App.net](http://app.net) client. It has gotten pretty slow on my iPhone 4, but I still keep coming back to it every day. Felix definitely is a top contender to the \"most used app\" spot.\n\n###[Sunstroke](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunstroke/id488564806?mt=8)\nFor my news reading I am using a [Fever](http://feedafever.com/) install on my server. Sunstroke is without a doubt the best way to access my Fever feeds on the iPhone and I have tried pretty much every Fever compatible iPhone client out there. It is not as versatile as [Mr. Reader](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8) on the iPad for sharing out items, but from a pure reading perspective I have yet to find a better app.\n\n###[Twitteriffic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-5-for-twitter/id580311103?mt=8)\n\nI hardly use [Twitter](https://twitter.com) anymore these days. [App.net](http://app.net) has almost completely replaced the service with the bird for me. However, a lot of my colleagues still use it and I need a way to occasionally respond to DMs and mentions. Twitteriffic is a beautiful and more then adequate Twitter client for this job.\n\n###[Articles](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articles/id364881979?mt=8)\n\nFor my [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) research I prefer to use a dedicated client like Articles. This is one area where I grabbed the client that looked best for me way back when I got my first iPhone and I just never tried another one. So there might be better Wikipedia clients out there, but Articles suits me just fine.\n\n###[dict.cc](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dict.cc-dictionary/id327732352?mt=8)\n\nWhile my English is reasonably good, I do need to look up words once in a while. I found dict.cc a pretty good dictionary. Plus it is an offline dictionary, which is still something I rely on occasionally in spots with bad reception.\n\n###[WeatherPro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weatherpro/id294631159?mt=8)\n\nI usually check the weather by looking out the window—now there's a revolutionary idea! But when I need to look up the weather at a travel destination or to check a forecast for the upcoming week WeatherPro has proven to be the most reliable app for Germany and Europe in general. And it has nice detailed statistical infos and weather radar imagery. Not that I could make heads or tails of those, but they look nice.\n\n###[Outbank](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outbank/id585564091?mt=8)\n\nFor German bank accounts there is nothing better then Outbank. It is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and it actually works with a wide array of banks. While I don't check my accounts daily, Outbank is certainly the cornerstone of my own digital accounting and that of our business.\n\n###[Screens VNC](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screens-vnc-access-your-computer/id655890150?mt=8)\n\nAnother one of these \"don't use often, but critical when I do\" apps. Screens allows me to quickly fix things on our server even when I am hundreds of kilometers away from home. Together with Screens Connect, its desktop counterpart, setup is a breeze and I don't have to trouble myself with ports and SSL, etc. It just works.\n\n###[Pushpin](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pushpin-for-pinboard/id548052590?mt=8)\n\nI use [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) for everything bookmarking related, including keeping a downloadable archive of the bookmark, meaning if the page you bookmarked goes offline, you'll still be able to see the archived copy indefinitely.\n\nAnd a big feature for me is that I use Pinboard as Instapaper replacement. Pushpin is the client that helps me achieve that last part. Right now it is a basic way to browse my bookmarks and catch up on my unread items. However, there is a feature in the works that will make my goal of using Pinboard and Instapaper replacement complete: Offline reading. I don't know when exactly it is coming, but I was assured it is coming and when the day comes it will be glorious. Or so I hope…\n\n###[Dropbox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8){#dropbox}\n\nI don't use the app that often, but it is very comforting to know that I have the option. Getting at anything in my Dropbox within a matter of seconds is truly convenient.\n\n###[FaceTime](http://www.apple.com/ios/facetime/)\n\nSkype can suck it. Especially since Microsoft took over and ruined the app even more. 'Nuff said.\n\n##Productivity {#productiviy}\n\nProductivity is such a loaded word that I try to avoid it. In this case I really am referring to apps that allow me to do work or to keep track of stuff.\n\n###[1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8)\n\nI don't think I'd be able to survive without 1Password. I'd have to use the same password everywhere or juggle paper lists or something. Madness would ensue pretty quickly I am sure. \n\nThankfully, AgileBits has me covered in the insanity department. 1Password is the first app I install on any machine. And since it syncs via Dropbox I can access my password library [even when I am on a random computer with Internet access](http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/1passwordanywhere.html).\n\n###[Begin](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/begin-your-daily-to-do-list/id687455038?mt=8)\n\nGreat little to do list app. Simple and very bare bones. Just what I need. I also have Omnifocus, but rarely use it. Begin I actually do use. It is a refreshing take on the old paradigm of creating lists to check off.\n\n###Mail.app\n\nWhat can I say? I rely on email and I find the default mail app to be very much sufficient. I have used Sparrow in the past, but with iOS 7 I switched back to the default app and haven't looked back.\n\n###[Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8)\n\nWhile I prefer to write on my iPad, I do use Drafts on the iPhone to sketch out quick ideas or as simple pasteboard. Sync with the Drafts for iPad app is instantaneous, so I can start a thought on my iPhone and continue it on my iPad in Drafts or [Editorial](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8) without effort.\n\nI have set up a nice little array of custom actions in Drafts, which allows me to use it as a plain text journaling app or as a quick entry bucket for story ideas.\n\n###[Calendars 5](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calendars-5-smart-calendar/id697927927?mt=8)\n\nI used [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/app/fantastical-2/id718043190?mt=8) before Calendars, but as it turns out Calendars has the same natural language event creation, but a much nicer calendar interface. I don't use a calendar that often really, but it is always a pleasure to use Calendars 5 when I have to.\n\n###[PCcalc](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite-best-free-calculator/id300311831?mt=8)\n\nPowerful, quick, to the point. When I need to use a calculator this is the one I turn to. It allows me to be as simple or as complex in my calculations as I need to be and it can do so much more like convert units. Though for unit conversion I tend to use [Vert](#vert).\n\nI linked to the free version above as that is already plenty powerful and if you so desire you can upgrade its functionality to suit your needs, which is exactly what I have done.\n\n###[Vert](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vert-2-unit-currency-converter/id691346630?mt=8){#vert}\n\nVert is another one of those laser focused apps without any cruft, a concept that I seem to really gravitate to, don't I? Vert does exactly what it says on the tin. It converts a wide array of units and does so in a fast and efficient manner.\n\n###[CarbonFin Outliner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outliner/id284455726?mt=8)\n\nSometimes I need a list that is neither a todo list nor a full outline or mindmap. CarbonFin Outliner fills that niche nicely. It is very much alike the famous [OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner) condensed down for iPhone. It can be used as todo list app or as full blown outliner with comments and the likes. But it is clean enough that I can use it for my simple list making.\n\n###[Navigon](http://www.navigon.com/portal/us/produkte/navigationssoftware/mobile_navigator_iphone_us.html)\n\nThe only turn by turn navigation I use. It is accurate, regularly updated with up to date map data and is generally nice to use. \n\nFrom the looks of it my global version of Navigon isn't offered any longer on the App Store. Instead there are several region based apps at a cheaper price.\n\n###[DB Navigator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/db-navigator/id343555245?mt=8)\n\nThe app of the German railway services. More of a nuisance then a must have, but it is better then juggling paper tickets.\n\n##Media {#media}\n\n###[Castro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-high-fidelity-podcasts/id723142770?mt=8)\nThe new kid on the podcast client block has bedazzled me from the day it came out. Yes, it is very minimal in its feature set. However, I found that it actually offers all the features I need and not more. Before I was using [Instacast](https://itunes.apple.com/app/instacast-3/id577056377?mt=8) and lately [Downcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8), both great apps, but much too fiddly. \n\nI am so much happier with Castro and without feature bloat. Give it a try. You might like it.\n\n###[Audible](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audiobooks-from-audible/id379693831?mt=8)\n\nI cannot say enough good things about Audible. I love the way their service works. I love audiobooks. I love this app. That plus the fact that the support is simply awesome. Recently I found out that you can return two books a year within a year of purchase for a full refund without challenge from the staff. How awesome is that?\n\nI highly recommend a membership with them.\n\n###[Naturespace](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/naturespace-relax-meditate/id312618509?mt=8)\n\nSometimes I need to switch off my brain completely or shut out the world. Naturespace is brilliant for that. It offers a great collection of high quality nature sounds that really transport you to the recorded location when you close your eyes. \n\nListening to nature is a poor mans replacement to actually going outside, but it is worlds better then blasting my ears with music all day or using white noise to drown out environmental distractions.\n\n###[Camera+](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera+/id329670577?mt=8)\n\nMy preferred quick and dirty image editor on the go. It has some nice filters and allows for some quick edits. And it allows me to share my pictures quickly and painlessly.\n\nThere are other similar image editors like VSCO Cam (which I won't link to, because I despise it), but they all are too slow, ugly or have horrible filters in my opinion.\n\n###[Filterstorm Neue](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filterstorm-neue/id728479183?mt=8)\n\nNow this is a real work horse. Where Camera+ is my *Instagram* app, Filterstorm is my image editor on the go. It is pretty amazing what the developer has managed to pull of here. Quick, high quality editing on a tiny screen and excellent sharing options including direct FTP upload.\n\n###[AutoStitch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autostitch-panorama/id318944927?mt=8)\n\nI do love panoramas. While the iOS panorama feature looks neat, my iPhone 4 is unable to use it. Also, I usually need more then a single horizontal strip of photos for my panoramas. \n\nAutoStitch is the best panorama app I have found. I can throw any amount of images at it snapped in all kinds of angles and it stitches them into a coherent panorama at a great quality and at up to 18 megapixels if I so desire.\n\n###[CameraSync](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camerasync/id406645727?mt=8)\n\nOnce my images have been taken and edited, I upload them to [Dropbox](#dropbox), my main storage location for all my pictures. CameraSync does so automatically in the background with a good selection of powerful options including the ability to prevent screenshots and videos from being uploaded if one so wishes.\n\n###[Unbound](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unbound-for-dropbox/id586086921?mt=8)\n\nAfter my images have uploaded with CameraSync I tend to delete them from my device. Unbound allows me to browse my complete image library from [Dropbox](#dropbox) in a nice interface.\n\n###[Paprika](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-for/id406732590?mt=8)\n\nA cooking app isn't exactly media, but it is the only category that semi-fit. Paprika is a great recipe app, because it is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and the recipes are synced between the devices. I can type in a new recipe when I am away for work and my wife can cook the dish at home a minute later or vice versa. Perfect.\n\n##Shopping {#shopping}\n\n###[Amazon](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-app/id297606951?mt=8)\n\nI get **everything** from Amazon. The app is at the same time convenient and really not great to use. But it is better then the website at least from the iPhone, so I'm using it.\n\n###[Kickstarter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kickstarter-for-iphone/id596961532?mt=8)\n\nHi. My name is Alex and I have a Kickstarter addiction.\n\nSeriously though, I love browsing [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) projects in the app for awesome projects, while at the same time hoping that there won't be, so I don't feel compelled to throw money out the window.\n\nI really should delete this app…\n\n###[Delivery Status Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/delivery-status-touch-package/id290986013?mt=8)\n\nThe best way to track where my shipments are at. Fullstop. Again a service that syncs across iOS and OS X. Those are really the most versatile, aren't they?\n\n## Summary\n\nPew, that was quite the list. While I don't use everything on this list daily and these are by far not the only apps I have installed on my iPhone, I would consider this group of apps essential for my daily work and play. I hope there were some nuggets in there for you [#teamappdiction](https://alpha.app.net/hashtags/teamappdiction) people. :)\n",

Sounds like an awful lot of work for something that Tumblr offers for free. Tumblr even has an iOS app. Just log in and be done with it.</p>\n<p>For me it comes down to owning what I create. And that involves hosting  what I create. Yes, Kirby is a little more involved and— <em>gasp</em> —costs money, but it is really flexible—I built several sites with it for myself, friends and even customers—, fast and pretty cheap considering.</p>\n<p>Plus it works with text files and Markdown, both things that I value dearly and that make this specific workflow possible without a special &ldquo;<em>Kirby iOS app</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"drafts-optional\">Drafts (optional)</h3>\n<p><em>For completeness sake I&rsquo;m including my Drafts workflow as well. However, I have since completely switched over to Editorial for writing as well as post-processing my posts.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I started writing my posts in Agile Tortoise&rsquo;s Drafts, a fine and frictionless text editor with the added bonus that it supports the x-callback URL scheme and a ton of other ways to share or manipulate the written word.</p>\n<p>When I write a blog entry, I put the post&rsquo;s title in the first line and the actual post content right after it. If I want a subtitle, that goes at the very bottom with the tag <code>Subtitle:</code></p>\n<p>So a typical post in Drafts would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>This is my title\n\nAnd this is my content.\nIt can have any content. Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it.\n\n----\n\nSubtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle.\n</code></pre>\n<p>When it comes time to share my post with the world, I have a Dropbox action called <em>Blog Post</em>, that will create a file in a designated Dropbox folder—I have a global <em>Apps</em> folder and I put it in a subfolder there—with the name of my post title as filename. It will also fill in a couple of things for me. Most notably the date and the title. So the above post transforms into:</p>\n<p>&lsquo;<code>This is my title.md</code>&rsquo; with the following content:</p>\n<pre><code>Title: This is my title\n\n----\n\nDate: 07.11.13 (used for display purposes)\n\n----\n\nTime: 2013-11-07-17-33-55 (used for sorting purposes)\n\n----\n\nAnd this is my content.\nIt can have any content. Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it.\n\n----\n\nSubtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can import this action into Drafts by clicking this link: <a href=\"drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=dropbox&amp;name=Blog%20Post&amp;path=%2FApps%2FDrafts%2FKirby%2FBlog%2F&amp;filenametype=1&amp;filename=&amp;ext=md&amp;writetype=0&amp;template=Title%3A%20%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0ADate%3A%20%5B%5Bdate%7C%25d.%25m.%25Y%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0ATime%3A%20%5B%5Btime%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0AText%3A%20%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D\">→ Import Blog Posts action into Drafts</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"editorial\">Editorial</h3>\n<p><em>This first part is part of the old Drafts workflow. Jump to the second part to see how I&rsquo;m working right now.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"the-old-way\">The <em>old</em> way</h4>\n<p>The next two steps are only for the times I want or need images in my posts or if I want to create one of those snazzy banners that are sorely underrepresented in my blog.</p>\n<p>I use Editorial as a simple text filter in this case. I could write something like this for Pythonista to make it work on iPhone (Editorial is iPad only), but I, well, I didn&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>\n<p>Editorial simply gives me back the future path of my new blog post, something I need if I want to drop pictures into that folder without hunting for the correct folder in my next step.</p>\n<p>I send over my post from Drafts to Editorial with a simple x-callback URL.</p>\n<p>You can import the URL Action into Drafts by clicking this link: <a href=\"drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=URL&amp;name=Copy%20Blog%20Path&amp;url=editorial%3A%2F%2F%3Fcommand%3D%7B%7Bcreate%20blog%20URL%7D%7D%26input%3D%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D\">→ Import URL action &ldquo;Copy Blog Path&rdquo; into Drafts</a></p>\n<p>Editorial then cleans it up in a variety of ways. For example, everything gets turned to lowercase, spaces are removed, etc.</p>\n<p>The resulting URL is copied to the clipboard. In the example above <code>This is my title</code> turns into <code>http://alexanderkucera.com/20131108-this_is_my_title</code>.</p>\n<p>I opted not to run any action after this, as I want to be able to switch to any app I want as the situation requires. But usually it is now on to <em>Filterstorm</em>.</p>\n<p>If you want to import the URL cleanup workflow into Editorial or simply read through it in detail, you can take a look at this <a href=\"http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5035202761981952/hTzXZVeWcLI\">&ldquo;create blog URL&rdquo; Editorial Action</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"the-new-way\">The <em>new</em> way</h4>\n<p>Since I have completely switched over from Drafts to Editorial, I had to create a workflow that would prep a standard Markdown document and turn it into a blog post. Since Editorial is much more powerful then Drafts, I was also able to make it a bit smarter, ask for input on a few things and optionally archive or delete a post once I&rsquo;m done with it.</p>\n<p>It does a lot of things similar to my Drafts workflow though. After all is said and done, a file with the correct naming scheme gets written to a Dropbox folder. And I also get the blog URL at the end from the workflow above.</p>\n<p>The bonus with the Editorial workflow is that I don&rsquo;t need to watch out for any specific formatting. I can have a standard Markdown document and everything <em>just works™</em>. And Editorial is just really pleasant to work in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5895905618165760/iEqPb0_XVkw\">Editorial Blog Posting Workflow</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"filterstorm-neue\">Filterstorm (Neue)</h3>\n<p>Filterstorm Neue, is brand new, but the old Filterstorm or Filterstorm Pro have pretty much the same abilities. Or you could use Photoforge 2 if you still have it. The important bit is that the app allows you to either <strong>export to Dropbox or to upload via FTP</strong> and to give your images <strong>a name of your choosing</strong>.</p>\n<p>Well, this step is really simple. Do your image edits. Done? Ok. Then upload it to the folder we just had the path created for in Editorial. Simple, right?</p>\n<p>Well, yes and no. There is one step that I consider crucial. I don&rsquo;t want to upload to my web server. I want to upload my image to Dropbox. I consider the Dropbox version of my site to be the canonical copy. Everything goes there first and then gets uploaded to the server. Otherwise I end up with a file mess. Files might get updated or changed here or there. Who knows? By always going Dropbox first, that issue gets sidestepped completely.</p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have an <em>always on</em> server machine, your best bet is to find a way to upload to Dropbox directly. Photoforge has a Dropbox uploading feature. Filterstorm does as well, though it involves browsing to your posts folder manually instead of just giving it a path.</p>\n<p>For various reasons, mostly because I don&rsquo;t want to hunt down a folder and I have the exact path I need from my Editorial workflow above, I decided to go a completely different route: FTP.</p>\n<p>I happen to use CrushFTP for work anyway, which means I just need to set up an FTP account that points to the blog&rsquo;s content folder in my server&rsquo;s Dropbox folder and the rest is very straightforward. Get path from Editorial and upload to said path.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hazel\">Hazel</h3>\n<p>The last and final step. The one step that unifies desktop and iOS blogging. Automatically uploading my posts from Dropbox to the server. Hazel is the perfect match for that. Especially since it got the ability to open an FTP connection on its own a couple of versions back.</p>\n<p>The Hazel flow goes like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look into the Drafts Or Editorial app folder and check if there is new post.</li>\n<li>Put the file into a subfolder called <code>&lt;date&gt;-postname</code>.</li>\n<li>Rename the file to <code>article.md</code> (the name of my Kirby layout template for a blog post)</li>\n<li>move the new folder with the post in it into my blog</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There another Hazel rule takes over as Hazel rules only ever can work on one folder at a time. It goes like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a folder? Look into it.</li>\n<li>Any file that doesn&rsquo;t have a red or grey color tag and that has been modified within the day gets uploaded</li>\n<li>After the upload color the file grey</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The color tags are there to stop Hazel from constantly uploading files that have been modified inside the &ldquo;today&rdquo; timeframe. But they also allow me to simply take off the color label if I want a file to be re-uploaded.</p>\n<p>Grab the Hazel ruleset here: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hazelrules.zip<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>The one called <code>Drafts-Editorial-Folder</code> is for the incoming Drafts or Editorial file and the one called <code>Kirby-Blog-Folder</code> monitors the Kirby blog folder.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-it\">That&rsquo;s it.</h2>\n<p>See? Simple, right?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Subtitle: Kirby, iOS, Drafts, Editorial, Filterstorm and Hazel tied into a neat bundle</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr\">Too long; Didn&rsquo;t read</a>&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it.\n\t\n\t----\n\t\n\tSubtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle.\n\t\nYou can import this action into Drafts by clicking this link: [→ Import Blog Posts action into Drafts](drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=dropbox&name=Blog%20Post&path=%2FApps%2FDrafts%2FKirby%2FBlog%2F&filenametype=1&filename=&ext=md&writetype=0&template=Title%3A%20%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0ADate%3A%20%5B%5Bdate%7C%25d.%25m.%25Y%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0ATime%3A%20%5B%5Btime%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0AText%3A%20%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D)\n\n### Editorial\n\n*This first part is part of the old Drafts workflow. Jump to the second part to see how I'm working right now.*\n\n---\n\n#### The *old* way\n\nThe next two steps are only for the times I want or need images in my posts or if I want to create one of those snazzy banners that are sorely underrepresented in my blog.\n\nI use Editorial as a simple text filter in this case. I could write something like this for Pythonista to make it work on iPhone (Editorial is iPad only), but I, well, I didn't feel like it.\n\nEditorial simply gives me back the future path of my new blog post, something I need if I want to drop pictures into that folder without hunting for the correct folder in my next step.\n\nI send over my post from Drafts to Editorial with a simple x-callback URL.\n\nYou can import the URL Action into Drafts by clicking this link: [→ Import URL action \"Copy Blog Path\" into Drafts](drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=URL&name=Copy%20Blog%20Path&url=editorial%3A%2F%2F%3Fcommand%3D%7B%7Bcreate%20blog%20URL%7D%7D%26input%3D%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D)\n\nEditorial then cleans it up in a variety of ways. For example, everything gets turned to lowercase, spaces are removed, etc.\n\nThe resulting URL is copied to the clipboard. In the example above `This is my title` turns into `http://alexanderkucera.com/20131108-this_is_my_title`.\n\nI opted not to run any action after this, as I want to be able to switch to any app I want as the situation requires. But usually it is now on to *Filterstorm*.\n\nIf you want to import the URL cleanup workflow into Editorial or simply read through it in detail, you can take a look at this [\"create blog URL\" Editorial Action](http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5035202761981952/hTzXZVeWcLI)\n\n#### The *new* way\n\nSince I have completely switched over from Drafts to Editorial, I had to create a workflow that would prep a standard Markdown document and turn it into a blog post. Since Editorial is much more powerful then Drafts, I was also able to make it a bit smarter, ask for input on a few things and optionally archive or delete a post once I'm done with it. \n\nIt does a lot of things similar to my Drafts workflow though. After all is said and done, a file with the correct naming scheme gets written to a Dropbox folder. And I also get the blog URL at the end from the workflow above.\n\nThe bonus with the Editorial workflow is that I don't need to watch out for any specific formatting. I can have a standard Markdown document and everything *just works™*. And Editorial is just really pleasant to work in. \n\n[Editorial Blog Posting Workflow](http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5895905618165760/iEqPb0_XVkw)\n\n### Filterstorm (Neue)\n\nFilterstorm Neue, is brand new, but the old Filterstorm or Filterstorm Pro have pretty much the same abilities. Or you could use Photoforge 2 if you still have it. The important bit is that the app allows you to either **export to Dropbox or to upload via FTP** and to give your images **a name of your choosing**.\n\nWell, this step is really simple. Do your image edits. Done? Ok. Then upload it to the folder we just had the path created for in Editorial. Simple, right?\n\nWell, yes and no. There is one step that I consider crucial. I don't want to upload to my web server. I want to upload my image to Dropbox. I consider the Dropbox version of my site to be the canonical copy. Everything goes there first and then gets uploaded to the server. Otherwise I end up with a file mess. Files might get updated or changed here or there. Who knows? By always going Dropbox first, that issue gets sidestepped completely.\n\nIf you don't have an *always on* server machine, your best bet is to find a way to upload to Dropbox directly. Photoforge has a Dropbox uploading feature. Filterstorm does as well, though it involves browsing to your posts folder manually instead of just giving it a path.\n\nFor various reasons, mostly because I don't want to hunt down a folder and I have the exact path I need from my Editorial workflow above, I decided to go a completely different route: FTP. \n\nI happen to use CrushFTP for work anyway, which means I just need to set up an FTP account that points to the blog's content folder in my server's Dropbox folder and the rest is very straightforward. Get path from Editorial and upload to said path.\n\n### Hazel\n\nThe last and final step. The one step that unifies desktop and iOS blogging. Automatically uploading my posts from Dropbox to the server. Hazel is the perfect match for that. Especially since it got the ability to open an FTP connection on its own a couple of versions back.\n\nThe Hazel flow goes like this:\n\n* Look into the Drafts Or Editorial app folder and check if there is new post.\n* Put the file into a subfolder called `<date>-postname`.\n* Rename the file to `article.md` (the name of my Kirby layout template for a blog post)\n* move the new folder with the post in it into my blog\n\nThere another Hazel rule takes over as Hazel rules only ever can work on one folder at a time. It goes like this:\n\n* Is there a folder? Look into it.\n* Any file that doesn't have a red or grey color tag and that has been modified within the day gets uploaded\n* After the upload color the file grey\n\nThe color tags are there to stop Hazel from constantly uploading files that have been modified inside the \"today\" timeframe. But they also allow me to simply take off the color label if I want a file to be re-uploaded.\n\nGrab the Hazel ruleset here: <a href=\"https://alexanderkucera.com/uploads/2024/hazelrules.zip\">hazelrules.zip</a>\n\nThe one called `Drafts-Editorial-Folder` is for the incoming Drafts or Editorial file and the one called `Kirby-Blog-Folder` monitors the Kirby blog folder.\n\n## That's it.\n\nSee? Simple, right?\n\n----\n\nSubtitle: Kirby, iOS, Drafts, Editorial, Filterstorm and Hazel tied into a neat bundle\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I wanted to share this litte trick with you for quite a while now, but of course I have been busy and other things came in the way. They always do.</p>\n<p>I work with my MacBook Pro at home and at the office. That is of course nice, because it is my only base of operations and I have everything in one place.</p>\n<p>But do you know the feeling that you are working with your laptop at work and don’t want anyone to snoop around on it, because it also is your private laptop and has all kinds of personal stuff on it? I know I do.</p>\n<p>Luckily there is an easy fix for that. Enable the setting that pops up a password request after your machine wakes from sleep or when it disables the screen saver. But now you always have to enter the password at home, too. Kind of annoying.</p>\n<p>There is an easy fix for that as well. The key is location aware software like [MarcoPolo] <a href=\"http://www.symonds.id.au/marcopolo/\">1</a>. MarcoPolo allows you to trigger certain actions depending on where it knows you are at the moment. Pretty cool stuff.

				"content_text": "\nI wanted to share this litte trick with you for quite a while now, but of course I have been busy and other things came in the way. They always do.\n\nI work with my MacBook Pro at home and at the office. That is of course nice, because it is my only base of operations and I have everything in one place.\n\nBut do you know the feeling that you are working with your laptop at work and don’t want anyone to snoop around on it, because it also is your private laptop and has all kinds of personal stuff on it? I know I do.\n\nLuckily there is an easy fix for that. Enable the setting that pops up a password request after your machine wakes from sleep or when it disables the screen saver. But now you always have to enter the password at home, too. Kind of annoying.\n\nThere is an easy fix for that as well. The key is location aware software like [MarcoPolo] [1]. MarcoPolo allows you to trigger certain actions depending on where it knows you are at the moment. Pretty cool stuff. That means it allows you to enable or disable the screen saver password at home or at work. Neat isn’t it?\n\nI made a little [screencast] [2] walking you through the steps.

But then I thought it is stupid to have to change my status message of my chat client outside my chat client.

I’d have to switch the room to a Jabber connection to send my message to the twitter user.\n\n>With my script I am independent of the room I am in. It just intercepts the command and send it to Twitter. I don’t have to think about sending it to a specific user or anything else. I just type my command and it sends.\n\n>Very easy, very “out of my way”. I like to keep it simple, otherwise I end up not using it.\n\n---\n\n>Rinoa Says: \n\n> Found you on digg.

Say something like “I heard, that doing job X like this means loosing quality. Is that right or did you find a way around it?”. It’s a win-win situation.\n\nIf you are right about it, your (probably more experienced) future co-workers, will be impressed because although you never worked in the area you have done your homework.\nIf you are wrong, you don’t make the impression of someone who didn’t do his homework, because you didn’t make a statement, you asked a question. And because you asked a question, you also have the chance to learn, because what you will now get is _an answer_.\n\nOf course this basically is true for every situation where you come into a group of people. You first should find out where you stand before you burn bridges.\n\nI just had to get this off my chest.\n",

How can a teapot be unfair? It is a simple geometry for crying out loud! If I had used a sphere or a torus (something not obviously produced by Pixar) it wouldn’t have made a difference.</p>\n<p>####“You didn’t use the right MotionBlur Settings, that is unfair!”</p>\n<p>Well, true, MentalRay also has something called Rapid Motion Blur.

				"content_html": "<p>As so many people from the MentalRay community seem to have a big problem with my motion blur test - and only that is seems, they don’t even see the parts, where I said good things about MentalRay - here is a small update with new images and the supposedly faster Rapid Motion Blur of MentalRay.</p>\n<p>Well, yes, I give you that Rapid Motion Blur is faster. But 19 minutes is still kind of slow in my book, especially with these artifacts Rapid Motion Blur introduced. But I am sure some MentalRay user will point me in the right direction how to get rid of them after reading this.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And here is again a Renderman version for direct comparison. This time I even increased the sampling, so the Motion Blur is more smooth then before. Still considerably faster then MentalRay. 6 minutes.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>How about this, we render the GI pass and maybe some reflections in MentalRay and then use this pass in Renderman, where we give is nice and fast Motion Blur?</p>\n<p>As I said before: This is not a “My toy better then your toy!” comparison. It is a test to see when it makes sense to use which renderer. No, MentalRay is not the big daddy of all renderers. Neither is Renderman.</p>\n<p>Need heavy GI and Reflections, but the scene is relatively static or doesn’t need Motion Blur for some reason? Hell, go with MentalRay any time! Even try it out on scenes without Raytracing. It might be faster then Renderman.</p>\n<p>But when you need fast Displacements and/or Motion Blur, stay away from MentalRay and use Renderman (or blur in post when the scene allows it).</p>\n<p>This is all about getting the job done. And I published this test to give some people hints about what to use when, as this is still a very often asked question, even more so with the new RfM plugin.</p>\n<p>People where interested, when I showed them this comparison and therefor, I made it available to a wider audience. …which of course took it apart and missed the point completely. But that was to be expected.</p>\n<p>Anyway before I drift into an endless monologue I better stop.</p>\n<p>####Following are the comments from the old blog</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>virgil Says:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You forget one thing.

				"content_text": "As so many people from the MentalRay community seem to have a big problem with my motion blur test - and only that is seems, they don’t even see the parts, where I said good things about MentalRay - here is a small update with new images and the supposedly faster Rapid Motion Blur of MentalRay.\n\nWell, yes, I give you that Rapid Motion Blur is faster. But 19 minutes is still kind of slow in my book, especially with these artifacts Rapid Motion Blur introduced. But I am sure some MentalRay user will point me in the right direction how to get rid of them after reading this.\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/239/2024/bigfancy-mentalray-render.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Mental Ray takes its time with 19 minutes\">\n\nAnd here is again a Renderman version for direct comparison. This time I even increased the sampling, so the Motion Blur is more smooth then before. Still considerably faster then MentalRay. 6 minutes.\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/239/2024/bigfancy-renderman-render.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Renderman renders the same setup in 6 minutes\">\n\nHow about this, we render the GI pass and maybe some reflections in MentalRay and then use this pass in Renderman, where we give is nice and fast Motion Blur?\n\nAs I said before: This is not a “My toy better then your toy!” comparison. It is a test to see when it makes sense to use which renderer. No, MentalRay is not the big daddy of all renderers. Neither is Renderman.\n\nNeed heavy GI and Reflections, but the scene is relatively static or doesn’t need Motion Blur for some reason? Hell, go with MentalRay any time! Even try it out on scenes without Raytracing. It might be faster then Renderman.\n\nBut when you need fast Displacements and/or Motion Blur, stay away from MentalRay and use Renderman (or blur in post when the scene allows it).\n\nThis is all about getting the job done. And I published this test to give some people hints about what to use when, as this is still a very often asked question, even more so with the new RfM plugin.\n\nPeople where interested, when I showed them this comparison and therefor, I made it available to a wider audience. …which of course took it apart and missed the point completely. But that was to be expected.\n\nAnyway before I drift into an endless monologue I better stop.\n\n####Following are the comments from the old blog\n\n>virgil Says:\n\n>You forget one thing.

Sad but true. I was distracted by the stiffness of the characters all the time. And I mean not only in motion, but also in the looks. The makers tried to be so true to nature, that everything feels like true…plastic.\n\n###So, is CG doomed to become more boring every day?\n\nLuckily not. While I was very disappointed by the Blender movie, I also found some marvelous examples of animation from some French students (thanks to Peter Soderbaum from Passive/Agressive). These movies saved my day and more. They gave me hope again, that somewhere out there are still creative heads, that try do lift their work out of the ordinary. Go and take a look at [Burning Safari] [3], a great funny short film. It has a great story, superb timing and a really nice look, that fits perfectly for the setting.\n\nAnd while you are there, you should not miss [the other movies of this years students of Gobelins l’ecole de l’image] [4]. I personally liked the Pirates movie best - even though it is not (plain) CG. But I just love the ending. Check it out -> [Pyrats] [5]\n\n[1]: http://www.elephantsdream.org/\n[2]: http://www.blender.org/cms/Home.2.0.html\n[3]: http://www.gobelins.fr/galerie/animation/gen2006-1.htm\n[4]: http://www.gobelins.fr/galerie/animation/annecy2006.htm\n[5]: http://www.gobelins.fr/galerie/animation/gen2006-3.htm\n",

				"content_html": "<p>[Keith Lango] <a href=\"http://keithlango.com/\">1</a> has an interesting article on his blog concerning [CG pictures/movies and how they have become boring] <a href=\"http://www.keithlango.com/wordpress/?p=143\">2</a>. Keith is of the opinion that the CG look has kind of worn of. We no longer have the “wow” moments when watching a nice full CG movie. And I must say I know what he means.</p>\n<p>Nowadays every guy in the backrow knows about 3D and VFX and that it isn’t a secret art. And that kind of pisses me off. I liked to do magic with pictures. I love the expression on the faces of people watching my (or any cool stuff for that matter) and be completely blown away by the uniqueness or pure beauty of effects. Maybe I am a nerd, but it was fun.</p>\n<p>Today all we do is making stuff realistic. Yeah! Bring it on! Let’s do stuff like we see it every day without CG!</p>\n<p>I have only one word for that: <strong>boring</strong></p>\n<p>I really am fed up with someone coming to me saying: “Hey can you do a magazine or CD or whatever object floating in an undefined space doing normal stuff (like opening and closing)? …oh and by the way, can you make it as realistic as possible?”</p>\n<p>It is kind of frustrating to work within bounds of one world, when all the candy is in the other world - the CG world - where we can do stuff that is unrealistic and exaggerated.</p>\n<p>Or is it just me and Keith?</p>\n<p>###Following are the comments from the old blog</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stickman Says:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Well, count me in. NPR has long been neglected, with endless raytracing programs on the market yet hardly any true NPR renderers. Hard to believe, for two reasons:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Look. A stylistically relevant yet unique look draws an audience. Madagascar shows the potential. So do most all the coffee-table art books of “boring3D” films where the artistic development looks SO much better than the final version.</li>\n<li>Efficiency. The last 10% of finalizing a Pixar-look film can comprise 90% of the effort - just think of hair groomers, particle specialists, geometry doctors. NPR looks are much more forgiving in this last phase and can allow for quicker finaling without compromising the visual impact.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In short: we need releases of software like “JOT”. For indy film-makers, students and even the big studios.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AlexK Says:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi David,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have never heard of JOT.

				"content_text": "\n[Keith Lango] [1] has an interesting article on his blog concerning [CG pictures/movies and how they have become boring] [2]. Keith is of the opinion that the CG look has kind of worn of. We no longer have the “wow” moments when watching a nice full CG movie. And I must say I know what he means.\n\nNowadays every guy in the backrow knows about 3D and VFX and that it isn’t a secret art. And that kind of pisses me off. I liked to do magic with pictures. I love the expression on the faces of people watching my (or any cool stuff for that matter) and be completely blown away by the uniqueness or pure beauty of effects. Maybe I am a nerd, but it was fun.\n\nToday all we do is making stuff realistic. Yeah! Bring it on! Let’s do stuff like we see it every day without CG!\n\nI have only one word for that: **boring**\n\nI really am fed up with someone coming to me saying: “Hey can you do a magazine or CD or whatever object floating in an undefined space doing normal stuff (like opening and closing)? …oh and by the way, can you make it as realistic as possible?”\n\nIt is kind of frustrating to work within bounds of one world, when all the candy is in the other world - the CG world - where we can do stuff that is unrealistic and exaggerated.\n\nOr is it just me and Keith?\n\n###Following are the comments from the old blog\n\n>stickman Says: \n\n>Well, count me in. NPR has long been neglected, with endless raytracing programs on the market yet hardly any true NPR renderers. Hard to believe, for two reasons:  \n1) Look. A stylistically relevant yet unique look draws an audience. Madagascar shows the potential. So do most all the coffee-table art books of “boring3D” films where the artistic development looks SO much better than the final version.  \n2) Efficiency. The last 10% of finalizing a Pixar-look film can comprise 90% of the effort - just think of hair groomers, particle specialists, geometry doctors. NPR looks are much more forgiving in this last phase and can allow for quicker finaling without compromising the visual impact.\n\n>In short: we need releases of software like “JOT”. For indy film-makers, students and even the big studios.\n\n---\n\n>AlexK Says: \n\n>Hi David,\n\n>I have never heard of JOT. Can you give me a link for it, please?
