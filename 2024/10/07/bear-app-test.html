		<p>This is a test of the Bear app for writing and note taking. So it turns out Bear does not publish to Micro.blog. Also the writing environment is not nearly as neat as Paper, even when I hide all the UI.</p>
<p>One advantage Bear has is that is supports images and other file formats in the notes. However, since it does not publish to Micro.blog that is of no help there as I still need to upload first and then include the link to the media file.</p>
<p>This is an online image test:

<p>And Bear seems to suffer from the same thing that plagues Bear. It does not export paragraphs properly. Or at least it treats paragraphs in the app differently then on export. A Markdown paragraph is denoted by a blank line between bodies of text. Both Paper and Bear show a simple line-break as new paragraph, but on export the paragraphs get lost due to no extra line break being added. Not terribly hard to work around, but worth noting.</p>
<p>But then again, Bear is about a third of the yearly cost. Which makes the choice actually harder and not easier.</p>
