		<p>This is a quick test about how the Paper app works. I recently read the <a href="https://havn.blog/2024/09/29/app-review-paper.html">Paper review</a> by Erlend on his Havn blog, which lead to me reading the terrific <a href="https://papereditor.app/dev">three part series</a> by the Paper developer on how Paper came together. It showed a level of care and detail that I highly appreciate.</p>
<p>So now here I am writing this in Paper and really enjoying the experience. I will compare this to Bear in another post. Both offer the ability to publish to Micro.blog as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Two paragraphs in and Paper already shines. But it does come with a hefty price tag. Considering I don‘t write professionally, it is a bit of a hard pillow to shallow. Let‘s see how it goes in Bear.</p>
<p>Now a quick image test:
