		<p>So, I went to the dentist today to get a dental cleaning. My last dental cleaning was about six months ago, and the one before that was about three years prior. I was told last time that because the time between cleanings was so long, the cleaning took over an hour and that I should go more often.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I did. And guess what? The cleaning still took over an hour. Not only that, but there was a 50% price increase since last time.</p>
<p>50%!</p>
<p>I wish I could increase my rates by 50%. That is ten times the current inflation rate. Ridiculous. I think Iâ€™ll take my chances and spread apart the cleanings to every other year again, because I do not see the value in getting this done every six months.</p>
