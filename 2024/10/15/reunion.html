		<p>I am leaving for our gymnasium reunion in two days. I haven&rsquo;t seen any of my old school friends in at least ten years. I&rsquo;ve never been much of a social person; while I enjoy the company of friends, I&rsquo;m not particularly good at keeping in touch.</p>
<p>So, I am essentially meeting a bunch of strangers in four days. I&rsquo;m not very good at social gatherings where I don&rsquo;t know anyone, so I&rsquo;m unsure how I feel about the reunion. On one hand, I&rsquo;m looking forward to it; on the other, I&rsquo;m really dreading it.</p>
<p>My health situation doesn&rsquo;t help to make me feel less awkward. Having a stiff neck that is locked at an angle, making my most comfortable stance one that looks at people&rsquo;s crotches, is, well, suboptimal.</p>
