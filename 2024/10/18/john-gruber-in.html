<blockquote>
<p>Also, I really dislike the practice of replacing passwords with email “magic links”. Autofilling a password from my keychain happens instantly; getting a magic link from email can take minutes sometimes, and even in the fastest case, it’s nowhere near instantaneous. Replacing something very fast — password autofill — with something slower is just a terrible idea. For people who actually prefer email magic links, it’s fine as an option, but it shouldn’t be the default, and it certainly shouldn’t be the only way to sign into an account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to agree. Magic links are more annoying then helpful. I‘d like them to be an option and not the norm. I‘ve had more then one occasion where I had to trigger a magic link several times before it arrived in my inbox. A simple email/password login would have been much more reliable and quicker.</p>
