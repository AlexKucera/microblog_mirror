		<p>People that are inconsiderate with other people‘s time piss me off to no end!</p>
<p>My wife regularly makes appointments for new children/parents. About 30% just never show up. No excuse. No call. Nothing. And about 10% of those have the gall to call a few days later for a second appointment (still no excuses).</p>
<p>And this is in a field where there is a shortage of spots for the kids. How entitled must you be to search for a nanny for your kid—of which there are to few—and then not show up?</p>
<p>Go fuck yourselves!</p>
