		<p>I quit Twitter a little over a year ago officially. Similarly I haven‘t used any of the other services like Facebook, LinkedIn, Mastodon, Slack, Skype or any of the others.</p>
<p>I simply post to my blog now via Micro.blog. Occasionally I respond to a post on Micro.blog. That‘s it. Other then that I live a life with the people around me. Family, friends, neighbors.</p>
<p>I don‘t miss a thing. Social media can be intoxicating and make you feel like you miss a ton if you don‘t constantly engage. This is a blatant lie you tell yourself. All you do is spinning your wheels while you could spend your time doing actually engaging or productive things.</p>
