		<p>Just finished watching Marvel’s Echo. It was underwhelming. There was a good underlying idea in there somewhere. I think. But by the final episode I still had no idea what it was supposed to be about. No clue about the main characters goals. But I love seeing Wilson Fisk portrayed by Vincent D’Onofrio. I guess that is worth something. Overall though. Sadly one big “meh”.</p>
