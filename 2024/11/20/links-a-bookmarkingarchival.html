		<p>I am getting closer to a working version of my own little bookmarking/archiving project. I tried Archivebox, Linkwarden, linkding and of course Pinboard and Raindrop. None of them quite did what I wanted. So I rolled up my sleeves and got to work.</p>
<p>Current state:</p>
<ul>
<li>save a given URL as PDF, Markdown and Web Archive (Warco)</li>
<li>a basic website displaying the saved links with a URL and a summary of the site as well as links to the archived files.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very bare bones right now, but it works. Also, and this is one of the big pluses for me, no tags, no categories. Just a list of links.</p>
<p>To be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS styling of the link list</li>
<li>a way to add links from the site</li>
<li>a way to add links on the go</li>
<li>a way to delete links on the site</li>
<li>search</li>
</ul>
