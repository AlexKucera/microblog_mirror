		<p>After reading about <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/github-spark">GitHub Spark</a> I felt inspired to see how good programming with an AI works.</p>
<p>So I set about using <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude/haiku">Claude 3.5 Haiku</a> to write a little Python program that archives a give URL as PDF, Markdown and saves a bunch of metadata along as well as summarizes the page with GPT4.</p>
<p>It took a bit of noodling and back an forth with the AI to smooth out the functionality and the errors I got. But I didn‘t code anything myself. Only copied and pasted a few code corrections here and there that the AI gave me.</p>
<p>And it works. I think I will continue on this path and make my own version of <a href="https://archivebox.io">Archivebox</a>.</p>
