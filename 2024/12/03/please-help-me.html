		<p>My son is into anime these days. But he’s watching what I can only describe as garbage.</p>
<p>Either it’s Pokémon style stuff like Hunter x Hunter. People standing around discussing attack modifiers and just a whiff off a story.</p>
<p>Or it’s full bosomed schoolgirls giggling into the camera.</p>
<p>Are there no modern anime with proper story and at least a modicum of style?</p>
<p>In my day I was watching stuff like Princess Mononoke, Ninja Scroll or Vampire Hunter D to name a few. Is there nothing liked that out there today on Amazon Prime or Crunchyroll?</p>
