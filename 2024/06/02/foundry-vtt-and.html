		<p>I recently discovered <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/">Foundry VTT</a> as a way to play role playing games with my friends from all over there the world.</p>
<p>I have spent a few days transferring a D&amp;D campaign to digital format and it is coming together just greatly. Great maps with flickering lights, atmospheric background music.</p>
<p>And I even found a way to have all the story hooks being read by a great AI narrator via <a href="https://elevenlabs.io">ElevenLabs</a>. They have a great Michael Kramer like voice (John Doe - Intimate) and I was able to get the whole campaign vocalized for just â‚¬5.</p>
