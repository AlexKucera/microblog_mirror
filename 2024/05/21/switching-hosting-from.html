		<p>So, after another round of failed communications with my current web host MidPhase—I have been waiting for over a week to hear back from support—I have decided to move hosts.</p>
<p>I am now with <a href="https://uberspace.de/">Uberspace</a>.</p>
<p>They had me interested for a long time now and I finally took the plunge and am loving it. Their business model is quite unique in that it is “pay what you want”. No strings attached. Same service for everyone. If you see the value and can afford it, you pay more. If not less. Down to €1/month.</p>
<p>Their interface is mostly SSH shell based, so one better be somewhat Terminal skilled.</p>
