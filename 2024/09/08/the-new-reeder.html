		<p>I tried the new Reeder app yesterday for about 20 minutes before deleting it again. It just didn’t fit my needs at all. Or maybe I simply didn’t get it.</p>
<p>The idea of an endless scrolling timeline stresses me out. No unread count. You mean there is no indication of it ever ending? That sounds stress inducing to no end.</p>
<p>With my RSS reader (the now called Reeder Classic), I have a ton of feeds that are very high frequency that I only scan to see if something pops out. I have a folder called favorites that I scan more closely. At the end I mark both the „firehose“ and the favorites as read. The posts disappear and I am at ease that I got the most important bits.</p>
<p>Then I open YouTube take a quick glance at what the homepage suggests. Usually junk. If there is something interesting it goes into my watch later queue. Then I scan my subscriptions. Same deal. Done.</p>
<p>I do this once a days in the morning. Once.</p>
<p>During the day I catch up on my Micro.blog feed, which is easy, becausee I only follow a couple of people compared to several hundreds I followed on Twitter.</p>
<p>I don’t need much morere then this. My past self probably would be all over Tapestry and the new Reeder. In fact, I did use a timeline aggregation app about ten years ago from Realmac Software that is no longer available and whose name I have forgotten. They were way ahead of their time back then. Maybe they should dust it off as well.</p>
