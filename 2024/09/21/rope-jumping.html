		<p>Today marks the start of me getting back into rope jumping. I actually wanted to start rowing, but I have no space for a rowing machine right now and I refuse to pay gym fees just to get access to a rowing machine.
So rope jumping it will be for the foreseeable future. I just need to be uber-careful to start <em>really</em> slow to ease my joints into it. They do <em>not</em> like sudden and prolonged strain.</p>
