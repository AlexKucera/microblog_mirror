		<p>I just read <a href="https://beforesandafters.com/2024/09/19/going-old-school-with-the-vfx-on-beverly-hills-cop-axel-f/">Going old-school with the VFX on ‘Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F’ - befores &amp; afters</a>. The VFX breakdown while interesting just shows what a waste of money it all is. I mean, how hard is it to spray a bit of water into Eddy Murphy‘s face on set? Instead your blow your money on several artists having to do matchmoving and simulating and compositing for several days.</p>
