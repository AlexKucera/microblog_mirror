		<p>I find this whole Fediverse/Mastodon thing really confusing. For example, when trying to follow John Gruber, there are like 6 different accounts he has registered. Each of which seems to have different content. So am I supposed to have ten times the accounts I follow now just because everyone has a dozen different accounts spread over the internet?</p>
