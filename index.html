			 <p>I just splurged for a Sublime Text license. It has been my workhorse for a couple of years now. I am ashamed to admit it took me this long to pay for it.</p>
<p>Sublime Text has this sneaky business model. You can download it and use it forever. There&rsquo;s no forced expiration date. Just a gentle reminder popup that appears every few saves. &ldquo;Hey, you should probably buy a license.&rdquo; <em>Click dismiss. Continue coding.</em> It&rsquo;s like having a really polite landlord who never actually demands rent.</p>
<p>In 2025, everyone talks about VS Code. It&rsquo;s free, it&rsquo;s powerful, but it&rsquo;s also built on Electron. That means it&rsquo;s slower and heavier than it needs to be. Sublime Text just works. It opens instantly. It handles large files without breaking a sweat. Then there&rsquo;s the plugin ecosystem. I can transform it from a simple text editor into whatever I need. Want a debugger? There&rsquo;s a plugin. Need advanced Git integration? Covered. It&rsquo;s like having a Swiss Army knife that keeps growing new tools.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing about using great software for free. It starts to feel weird after a while. Every time that purchase reminder pops up, there&rsquo;s this little voice in your head. &ldquo;You use this thing every day. You depend on it. Maybe you should actually pay for it?&rdquo; The guilt builds up slowly.</p>
<p>Sublime Text is made by a tiny company. They&rsquo;re not backed by Microsoft or Google. They survive on license sales from people like me who eventually do the right thing. When I finally clicked &ldquo;buy license,&rdquo; it wasn&rsquo;t just about legal compliance. It was about recognising value.</p>
<p>The license cost $99. For a tool that I use constantly and that just works without drama. I should have done this years ago. But better late than never, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this while dismissing that Sublime Text purchase dialog, maybe it&rsquo;s time. The guilt relief alone is worth the price.</p>

			 <p><em>Five export formats. Zero vendor lock-in. Complete data freedom.</em></p>
<p>Digital preservation isn&rsquo;t just about saving content. It&rsquo;s about maintaining access and control. Links embraces complete data freedom - your content should work everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>HTML Export - Browser Migration Made Easy</strong><br>
The universal standard. Every major browser imports HTML bookmark files. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - they all speak this language. Moving from Links to your browser&rsquo;s bookmark manager? One click export, one click import.</p>
<p><strong>CSV Export - Data Analysis Ready</strong><br>
Spreadsheet-friendly format with comprehensive metadata. URLs, titles, save dates, file sizes, AI summaries - everything in neat columns. Perfect for analysis, reporting, or integration with other tools.</p>
<p><strong>BAR Export - Complete Offline Archive</strong><br>
Creates a complete, offline-browsable archive of your entire collection. All your saved content, all your metadata, packaged into a single downloadable file. Internet goes down? Server crashes? You still have everything, fully accessible offline.</p>
<p><strong>Markdown Export - Knowledge System Integration</strong><br>
Each bookmark becomes a clean Markdown file with metadata headers and AI-generated summaries. Import directly into Obsidian, Notion, Logseq, or any Markdown-based knowledge system. Your archived links become part of your personal knowledge graph.</p>
<p><strong>JSON Export - Full System Backup</strong><br>
Every piece of data Links knows about your collection, structured for programmatic access. Perfect for backup, migration, or building your own tools. Nothing gets lost, nothing gets simplified.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just convenience. It&rsquo;s digital freedom. Too many tools trap your data with proprietary formats. Links takes the opposite approach - multiple export formats mean multiple escape routes. Your investment is protected.</p>
<p>Export functionality is live at <a href="https://links.alexanderkucera.de/">links.alexanderkucera.de</a> right now. Choose your format, click export, download your file. Your digital collection just became a lot more portable.</p>

			 <p><em>Major refactor brings JavaScript support and eliminates licensing fees.</em></p>
<p>Remember when I told you about Links <a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/07/links-the-bookmark-manager-that.html">saving your stuff</a> from the digital void? Well, it just got a complete technical overhaul.</p>
<p>The big news: Links now runs on a custom FastAPI Python implementation, ditching Kirby CMS entirely. Plus, it finally handles JavaScript-heavy sites that were previously impossible to archive.</p>
<h2 id="from-php-to-python">From PHP to Python</h2>
<p>The original Links was built on Kirby CMS. Great system, but it came with compromises. Licensed software means ongoing costs. PHP means working within CMS constraints. File-based content management that wasn&rsquo;t quite right for archival workflows.</p>
<p>So I rebuilt it from scratch in Python.</p>
<p>FastAPI replaced the entire web framework. Clean, fast, and designed for APIs from the ground up. The archiving scripts were already in Python - now everything speaks the same language.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-actually-means">What This Actually Means</h2>
<p><strong>No more licensing fees.</strong> Kirby required a one-time payment. FastAPI is completely open-source. Your self-hosted Links installation is now truly free.</p>
<p><strong>Slimmer codebase.</strong> Removed all the CMS bloat. No more fighting with file-based content management. No more PHP/Python context switching. Just focused Python code that does exactly what it needs to do.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript support.</strong> The new architecture made it much easier to integrate proper browser engines. Sites that load content dynamically now archive perfectly. Single-page apps, modern e-commerce, social platforms - they all work now.</p>
<h2 id="the-technical-evolution">The Technical Evolution</h2>
<p>Before this refactor, Links would hit a wall with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-page applications (SPAs)</li>
<li>Modern e-commerce sites</li>
<li>Social media platforms</li>
<li>Complex dashboard interfaces</li>
<li>Any site that builds content after page load</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it handles them all. The archiving process uses a proper browser engine, waits for JavaScript to execute, then captures everything. Content extraction gets the full picture. AI summaries actually have something meaningful to work with.</p>
<h2 id="still-the-same-simple-experience">Still the Same Simple Experience</h2>
<p>From your perspective, nothing changed. Share a link from iOS. Get the instant feedback. The background magic just got more powerful and more efficient.</p>
<p>The system still creates multiple archive formats. AI summaries still work. Full-text search still finds everything. But now it finds everything from sites that were previously impossible to archive properly.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a technical curiosity. It&rsquo;s about sustainability and control.</p>
<p><strong>Cost control.</strong> No licensing fees means lower barrier to entry for self-hosting. Your digital preservation tool doesn&rsquo;t depend on someone else&rsquo;s business model.</p>
<p><strong>Technical control.</strong> Custom FastAPI means the codebase does exactly what&rsquo;s needed. No more working around CMS limitations. No more PHP/Python impedance mismatch.</p>
<p><strong>Future-proofing.</strong> Python ecosystem means better integration with AI tools, archiving libraries, and modern web technologies. When the next big thing comes along, Links can adapt.</p>
<h2 id="production-ready">Production Ready</h2>
<p>This complete rewrite rolled out to the live system at <a href="https://links.alexanderkucera.de/">links.alexanderkucera.de</a>. No downtime. No lost data. No new workflows to learn.</p>
<p>Your JavaScript-heavy bookmarks are no longer second-class citizens. And your self-hosted installation just got a lot more sustainable.</p>
<h2 id="the-open-source-future">The Open Source Future</h2>
<p>With the Kirby dependency gone, Links is now completely open-source ready. No licensing complications. No vendor dependencies. Just Python code that preserves your digital discoveries.</p>
<p>Digital preservation for the rest of us just got a lot more accessible.</p>

<p><em>115 commits became a complete rewrite. Sometimes the best way forward is to rebuild from first principles.</em></p>

			<h1><a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/07/links-the-bookmark-manager-that.html">Links: The Bookmark Manager That Actually Saves Your Stuff</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/07/links-the-bookmark-manager-that.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-07-07 12:34:15 &#43;0200">Jul 7, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We&rsquo;ve all been there. You bookmark something important. Come back weeks later, link is dead. Content vanished, site changed, paywall appeared. The frustration of digital amnesia strikes again.</p>
<p>I got tired of losing things I wanted to keep.</p>
<h2 id="from-simple-idea-to-production-reality">From Simple Idea to Production Reality</h2>
<p>Links started as a basic bookmark manager. Just me, trying to organize my web finds. 115 commits later, it&rsquo;s become a full archival system. The evolution from &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; to &ldquo;can&rsquo;t live without&rdquo; surprised even me.</p>
<p>What began as simple URL storage grew into something much more powerful. Each commit taught me something new about what people actually need. Not just bookmarks - real preservation.</p>
<h2 id="the-mobile-revolution-">The Mobile Revolution üì±</h2>
<p>The game-changer was iOS Shortcuts integration. Now I can share from anywhere, archive automatically. Subway reading? One tap saves it. Meeting discovery? Boom, archived. Social media find? Got it.</p>
<p>The technical magic happens in two phases. You get instant feedback when you tap &ldquo;Share to Links.&rdquo; Meanwhile, the system spends 5-10 seconds downloading content. Background processing creates multiple archive formats. AI generates summaries. All while you move on with your day.</p>
<p>No more &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save this later&rdquo; mental notes. Just save it now, from wherever you are.</p>
<h2 id="smart-archiving-made-simple">Smart Archiving Made Simple</h2>
<p>Links doesn&rsquo;t just store URLs. It understands content. AI summaries using Claude (with OpenAI fallback) extract meaning from every page. Content extraction that actually works handles even tricky sites.</p>
<p>Multiple formats ensure long-term access:</p>
<ul>
<li>PDF archives preserve visual layout</li>
<li>Markdown conversion creates searchable text</li>
<li>WARC files maintain complete page context</li>
<li>Structured metadata enables programmatic access</li>
</ul>
<p>Full-text search works across all archived content. Find that thing you saved months ago in seconds.</p>
<p>The system handles edge cases gracefully. Broken sites, missing metadata, failed AI calls - it all degrades nicely. You never lose your bookmark, even when things go wrong.</p>
<h2 id="how-links-stands-apart">How Links Stands Apart</h2>
<p>The bookmark manager landscape is crowded. But Links takes a different approach than the competition.</p>
<p><strong>mymind.com</strong> uses AI for visual organization and discovery. Beautiful interface, smart tagging, visual search. But it&rsquo;s cloud-hosted, subscription-based, and focused on organization over preservation. When mymind&rsquo;s servers go down, your bookmarks go with them.</p>
<p><strong>Dewey</strong> captures content at bookmark time. Great for preservation, but limited mobile integration. <strong>Raindrop.io</strong> offers visual bookmarking with cloud backup. <strong>LinkAce</strong> provides self-hosted monitoring with Internet Archive integration.</p>
<p>Links combines the best ideas while avoiding common pitfalls:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File-based storage</strong> (no database headaches)</li>
<li><strong>Self-hosted control</strong> (your data, your rules)</li>
<li><strong>Actual content preservation</strong> (not just pretty organization)</li>
<li><strong>Seamless mobile integration</strong> (because that&rsquo;s where we live now)</li>
<li><strong>AI intelligence</strong> (without the subscription fees)</li>
</ul>
<p>While others focus on tags, categories, and visual discovery, Links focuses on one thing: making sure your stuff doesn&rsquo;t disappear.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-term-vision">The Long-Term Vision</h2>
<p>Digital preservation shouldn&rsquo;t be complicated. Regular people need tools that work without constant maintenance. Links embraces this philosophy.</p>
<p>In an era where websites vanish overnight, Links provides a personal solution. No tags, no categories, no complex workflows. Just chronological organization that makes sense. And yet, everything is still just one full-text search away.</p>
<p>Your data lives in human-readable files. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats. If you want to move elsewhere, everything exports cleanly.</p>
<p>This is digital preservation for the rest of us.</p>
<h2 id="ready-to-use-today">Ready to Use Today</h2>
<p>Links is production-ready right now. All core features work reliably. The mobile integration is smooth. The AI summaries are helpful. The search actually finds things.</p>
<p>After 115 commits of refinement, it&rsquo;s almost ready for prime time. I still need to bundle it up for distribution.</p>
<p>Until then, you can try Links at <a href="https://links.alexanderkucera.de">links.alexanderkucera.de</a>.</p>

<p><em>Links is open source and self-hostable. Built with Kirby CMS, Python archiving scripts, and a healthy dose of frustration with disappearing content.</em></p>

			 <p>I decided to pick up work on <a href="https://links.alexanderkucera.de/about">Links</a> my barebones bookmark manager three days ago. Several dozen commits later it is shaping up nicely.</p>
<p>It now has:</p>
<ul>
<li>a nicer more streamlined design</li>
<li>working full content search</li>
<li>AI based summaries that also work for images (which is great for the search part)</li>
<li>editable titles (either manually or AI generated)</li>
<li>the archiver now runs as a daemon in the background</li>
<li>API access so it works with iOS shortcuts, Python, etc.</li>
<li>overall refactoring to be more readable code</li>
<li>a randomizer that shows ten random bookmarks</li>
<li>updated and expanded the documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Still a few things to do though like adding more file types and maybe add thumbnails for other things then images.</p>
<p>But it is shaping up nicely and a proper release is visible on the horizon.</p>

<p>That used to be enough.</p>
<p>But life has a way of changing the game on you. When kidney issues landed me on dialysis, everything shifted. The energy I once had for longer writing sessions? Gone. The focus needed for those longer posts I loved crafting almost 15 years ago? Scattered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d sit down with brilliant ideas bouncing around in my head. But translating them into coherent, engaging posts felt like pushing a boulder uphill. The gap between what I wanted to say and what I could actually produce became this frustrating chasm.</p>
<p>Writing stopped being joy. It became work.</p>
<h2 id="the-unexpected-journey-to-ai">The Unexpected Journey to AI</h2>
<p>My path to AI-assisted writing didn&rsquo;t start with writing at all.</p>
<p>It began with images. MidJourney caught my attention first - the idea of creating visuals from text descriptions fascinated me. I&rsquo;m a coder at heart, so the concept of prompt engineering felt natural.</p>
<p>From there, curiosity led me to ChatGPT. Just playing around. Testing limits. Seeing what this AI thing could actually do.</p>
<p>TypingMind entered the picture as a better interface for managing these AI conversations. But the real breakthrough came when I discovered Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude models. Something about Claude&rsquo;s responses felt more&hellip; human. More collaborative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I started thinking: if AI can help with images and casual conversations, maybe it can help with the writing that&rsquo;s become so challenging.</p>
<h2 id="what-ai-actually-does-for-my-blog">What AI Actually Does for My Blog</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what people get wrong about AI writing assistance. They think it&rsquo;s about replacing the writer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>For me, AI bridges the gap between having ideas and having the energy to execute them properly. It&rsquo;s like having a research assistant, writing partner, and editor all rolled into one - but one who never gets tired when I need to take breaks.</p>
<p>The AI handles the heavy lifting of research. It pulls current facts, finds relevant examples, and organizes information in ways that make sense. When writer&rsquo;s block hits (and with health challenges, it hits more often), the AI helps me push through by generating different angles or approaches I hadn&rsquo;t considered.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the key: I&rsquo;m still driving the process. Every idea comes from me. Every direction change is my call. The AI just helps me get there without burning through the limited energy I have each day.</p>
<p>Since embracing this approach, I&rsquo;ve published more than I have in years. Not because I have a schedule to maintain, but because writing is enjoyable again.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-it-real">Keeping It Real</h2>
<p>Let me be crystal clear about something: if a post doesn&rsquo;t sound like me, it doesn&rsquo;t get published.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>The AI might help craft sentences or organize thoughts, but every published word has to pass my authenticity test. I work with the AI through multiple iterations, adjusting tone, refining arguments, and polishing until it genuinely feels like something I would write.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about tricking readers or taking shortcuts. It&rsquo;s about having the tools to express my actual thoughts and ideas when my body isn&rsquo;t cooperating with my creative ambitions.</p>
<p>The iterative process is crucial. I&rsquo;ll ask for revisions on specific paragraphs, request tone adjustments, or completely redirect sections that don&rsquo;t feel right. The AI is patient in ways human collaborators might not be - it doesn&rsquo;t get frustrated when I need the fifth version of the same paragraph.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-workflow">My Current Workflow</h2>
<p><strong>The Setup That Changed Everything</strong></p>
<p>I built my writing process around TypingMind, which lets me create specialized agents with different skills. My &ldquo;Professional Blog Writer&rdquo; agent is like having a writing partner who actually knows me.</p>
<p>The agent comes loaded with plugins that do the heavy lifting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perplexity Search for current research and facts</li>
<li>Sequential Thinking for structured outlines</li>
<li>Memoryplugin to remember my writing style and preferences</li>
<li>TubePlus for YouTube content analysis</li>
<li>Firecrawl for web scraping when I need specific sources</li>
<li>Image Search for visual inspiration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>From Idea to Published Post</strong></p>
<p>My process is surprisingly simple now. I start with just a topic idea or maybe a short summary of what&rsquo;s bouncing around in my head. Nothing fancy.</p>
<p>The AI immediately pulls up research, creates an outline, and we go back and forth until it feels right. Sometimes that&rsquo;s two exchanges. Sometimes it&rsquo;s ten. Depends on the complexity and how clear my initial thoughts were.</p>
<p>Then comes the actual writing. Here&rsquo;s where the Memory Plugin really shines - it usually nails my writing style on the first or second attempt because it remembers how I like things phrased, my sentence patterns, even my weird quirks.</p>
<p><strong>The Back-and-Forth Dance</strong></p>
<p>When something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, I&rsquo;m specific: &ldquo;Make this section more conversational&rdquo; or &ldquo;This paragraph is too formal for my voice.&rdquo; The AI adjusts, and we keep refining until I hit that moment where I think, &ldquo;Yes, this sounds like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole thing outputs in Markdown, so I just copy-paste into my blogging software. No reformatting headaches.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Works for Me</strong></p>
<p>The energy I used to burn on research and first drafts now goes into the creative refinement. I&rsquo;m collaborating rather than grinding. And because the AI learns my style over time, each post gets easier to perfect.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>The future of AI-assisted blogging isn&rsquo;t about replacing writers. It&rsquo;s about amplifying what they are already good at while compensating for their limitations - whether those are time, energy, health, or simply the occasional creative block.</p>
<p>For bloggers dealing with similar challenges, my advice is simple: start small. Pick one aspect of your writing process that frustrates you most and see if AI can help with that specific piece. Don&rsquo;t try to revolutionize everything at once.</p>
<p>The key is maintaining control. The AI is a tool, not a replacement. Your voice, your ideas, your standards - those don&rsquo;t change. What changes is having the support to express them even when life throws curveballs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more excited about blogging now than I&rsquo;ve been in years. Not because AI does the work for me, but because it helps me do the work I want to do, even when my body isn&rsquo;t fully cooperating.</p>
<p>And honestly? That&rsquo;s made all the difference.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Eight weeks ago, I had open kidney surgery. After being bedridden for most of my three and a half week hospital stay, that final week felt like a triumph.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d graduated from assisted walking to making it down the hospital floor and back on my own. By discharge day, I was walking the entire floor independently. I felt confident. Ready to get back to normal life.</p>
<p>That confidence lasted exactly ten meters outside the hospital.</p>
<p>Ten meters from my front door, I needed a thirty-second break. Just ten meters. The same distance I&rsquo;d been covering easily in the hospital corridors suddenly felt impossible. After feeling so capable walking those hospital floors, I felt like I&rsquo;d run a marathon.</p>
<p>By the end of that first day home, I&rsquo;d managed maybe thirty or forty meters total before admitting complete defeat. The difference between hospital walking and real-world walking hit me like a wall.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I didn&rsquo;t understand then. Hospital floors are designed for recovery. They&rsquo;re flat, climate-controlled, with handrails and places to rest every few meters. The real world has curbs, uneven pavement, weather, and distances that actually matter. Walking a hospital corridor doesn&rsquo;t prepare you for walking to your mailbox.</p>
<p>The medical reality is pretty straightforward, but no one really prepares you for the psychological whiplash. After weeks of bed rest followed by successful hospital walking, you think you&rsquo;re ready. Then you discover that three and a half weeks of lying still, even with that final week of corridor walking, has fundamentally changed what your body can handle.</p>
<p>Those first few days home were a study in humility I never wanted to take. Each day I&rsquo;d try to walk a little further. Some days I managed it. Other days I didn&rsquo;t. The frustrating part wasn&rsquo;t just the physical limitation‚Äîit was accepting that my hospital confidence had been completely misplaced.</p>
<p>I started tracking my progress. Not with meters or fancy apps, but with houses. How many houses down the street could I make it before needing a breather? Before I had to turn around? These landmarks became my measuring stick. When my confidence was shattered, making it one house further was concrete proof I was still getting better, even if it didn&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>
<p>The breakthrough came gradually, then suddenly. Around week four post-surgery, I realized I wasn&rsquo;t counting steps anymore. Week six, I was walking around the block. Week seven, I made it to the local park and back.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I walked 1.5 kilometers in thirty minutes without stopping once. I held a conversation the entire time. Eight weeks after surgery, four and a half weeks after that humbling ten-meter reality check.</p>
<p>What strikes me most isn&rsquo;t just the physical progress. It&rsquo;s how hospital walking creates false confidence that real-world recovery quickly corrects. Before surgery, walking was just transportation. Now it&rsquo;s proof that my body works outside controlled environments. Each step feels like a small victory over both the surgery and that initial confidence crash.</p>
<p>The research says most open surgery patients don&rsquo;t hit these milestones until week ten or twelve, especially after extended hospital stays. That feels good to hear, but it also makes me realize how misleading hospital walking can be. Your real recovery timeline starts when you leave the building.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re starting your own walking recovery after major surgery and hospitalization, here&rsquo;s what I wish someone had told me. Hospital walking is just the beginning. Don&rsquo;t let that final week of corridor confidence fool you into thinking you&rsquo;re ready for the real world. You&rsquo;re not, and that&rsquo;s completely normal.</p>
<p>Track everything once you&rsquo;re home. Write down distances, times, how you felt. After that initial confidence crash, the numbers become your proof of progress when your brain tells you you&rsquo;re moving backwards.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t compare your home walking to your hospital walking. They&rsquo;re completely different activities requiring different energy levels and skills. Hospital floors are recovery training wheels. Real-world walking is the actual test.</p>
<p>Consistency beats intensity every single time. I walked every day after discharge, even if it was just to the mailbox. Those tiny daily efforts compound faster than sporadic longer attempts. Your body needs to relearn movement in real environments, not just controlled hospital corridors.</p>
<p>Bad days will happen. Last week I had a terrible walking day where everything felt harder than usual. I questioned whether I was actually improving or just fooling myself. The next day I walked further than ever before. Recovery after that kind of confidence crash isn&rsquo;t linear.</p>
<p>The mental side of this recovery taught me things I never expected to learn. Humility, for one. Hospital walking had made me feel capable. Real-world walking reminded me I was still healing. Both were necessary parts of the process.</p>
<p>It also taught me to celebrate ridiculously small victories. Making it to the corner without stopping. Walking up three stairs without getting winded. Holding a conversation while moving. After that ten-meter wake-up call, these became genuine achievements worth acknowledging.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I&rsquo;m still technically in the recovery window. Open surgery patients don&rsquo;t hit full recovery until month three. That means I&rsquo;ve got another month of potential improvement ahead of me. The thought is both exciting and surreal.</p>
<p>My new goal is two kilometers by week ten. Then maybe three by month three. But honestly, I&rsquo;m less focused on the numbers now. The real victory is that walking feels normal again, even outside hospital corridors.</p>
<p>Recovery from major surgery isn&rsquo;t just about getting back to where you were. It&rsquo;s about developing a completely different appreciation for what your body can do in real environments, not just controlled ones. Every day I can walk 1.5 kilometers is a day I don&rsquo;t take for granted.</p>
<p>Eight weeks ago, that confident hospital walking meant nothing when faced with ten real meters. Today, 1.5 kilometers feels routine. That&rsquo;s not just physical healing‚Äîthat&rsquo;s rebuilding trust with your own body one step at a time, in the real world.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I sat down to write about productivity. Instead, I accidentally solved my productivity problem.</p>
<p>It started with a simple request. I wanted to turn my struggles with overwhelm and chronic illness into a blog post. Multiple interests pulling me in different directions, dialysis eating up twelve hours a week, YouTube consumption replacing creation - the usual productivity paradox.</p>
<p>You read more about it <a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/06/19/pulled-in-too-many-directions.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>But something unexpected happened during the conversation with my AI writing assistant. What began as research for a blog post became a real-time case study in how productive conversations actually work.</p>
<h2 id="the-original-problem">The Original Problem</h2>
<p>The setup was familiar to anyone who&rsquo;s ever felt overwhelmed by their own interests. I love coding, cooking, RPGs, fitness, reading. My wife has projects that need my support. I&rsquo;m supposed to be working on an iPad app for her. But instead of making progress on any of it, I find myself watching YouTube videos for hours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d even found a video that perfectly explained the problem - how our brains get hijacked by consumption, how creation provides more sustainable dopamine hits, how shifting from consumer to contributor changes everything.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/R4MInIP2c-A?si=rW29vhDlEfG-JAx7">The Habit that forces your brain to stop consuming</a></p>
<p>I understood the theory. I just couldn&rsquo;t implement it.</p>
<h2 id="the-conversation-that-changed-everything">The Conversation That Changed Everything</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your top priority right then?&rdquo; came the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the iPadOS app, since finishing that would help my wife greatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simple question. Clear answer. But then something interesting happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those twelve hours of dialysis per week? That&rsquo;s actually prime iPad development time. You could queue up iOS tutorials, work on app wireframes&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no Xcode for iPad,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;And my left arm is completely blocked with needles. I can&rsquo;t move it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudden silence. Then: &ldquo;Right, of course there&rsquo;s no Xcode for iPad. That was a pretty big oversight on my part.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="what-made-this-conversation-different">What Made This Conversation Different</h2>
<p>Most productivity advice fails because it&rsquo;s generic. It assumes everyone has the same constraints, the same energy levels, the same physical capabilities. The conversation became productive the moment my real constraints got acknowledged.</p>
<p>No judgment about not being able to code one-handed during medical treatment. No generic advice about &ldquo;just managing your time better.&rdquo; Instead: &ldquo;What can you realistically do one-handed on an iPad for four hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The questions kept getting more specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What does your energy level look like after dialysis?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;When are you actually at your Mac with both arms free?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What makes this app section so complicated?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Each question revealed another layer of reality that typical productivity advice ignores.</p>
<h2 id="the-lessons-hidden-in-the-dialogue">The Lessons Hidden in the Dialogue</h2>
<p><strong>Assumptions get corrected quickly.</strong> The Xcode-on-iPad suggestion was wrong, but it got corrected immediately instead of becoming the foundation for useless advice.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints clarify priorities.</strong> Once we established that dialysis time wasn&rsquo;t coding time, it became clear that the real development work had to happen during my four productive in-between days.</p>
<p><strong>Specificity beats generality.</strong> &ldquo;Work on the app&rdquo; is overwhelming. &ldquo;Identify the next three concrete actions for the app&rdquo; is actionable.</p>
<p><strong>Questions matter more than answers.</strong> The breakthrough didn&rsquo;t come from advice. It came from questions that helped me see my situation more clearly.</p>
<h2 id="the-meta-lesson">The Meta-Lesson</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I realized: the conversation itself was demonstrating the productivity principle I needed to learn.</p>
<p>Instead of consuming more productivity content, I was actively working through my specific situation. Instead of generic advice, I was getting targeted questions. Instead of feeling judged for my limitations, I was finding ways to work with them.</p>
<p>The conversation was creation, not consumption. It was collaborative problem-solving in real time.</p>
<h2 id="the-breakthrough-moment">The Breakthrough Moment</h2>
<p>The real breakthrough came when we identified that the missing section of the app wasn&rsquo;t just technically complicated - it was &ldquo;lots of different pieces.&rdquo; Suddenly the overwhelm made sense. It wasn&rsquo;t one elegant problem to solve, but fifteen mini-features that all needed to connect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if you just listed all the different pieces first? Not designing them, not coding them - just creating an inventory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it clicked. The paralysis wasn&rsquo;t about not knowing how to code. It was about not knowing where to start when everything felt connected to everything else.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-productivity">What This Means for Productivity</h2>
<p>The best productivity hack might be finding someone who asks better questions.</p>
<p>Not someone who gives you a system to follow. Not someone who tells you to eliminate distractions. Someone who helps you see your actual constraints clearly, then works with those constraints instead of ignoring them.</p>
<p>Generic productivity advice is like generic medical advice - it might work for some people, but it&rsquo;s useless if it doesn&rsquo;t account for your specific situation.</p>
<p>The real productivity breakthrough happens when you stop trying to fit your life into someone else&rsquo;s system and start building a system that fits your actual life.</p>
<h2 id="the-ironic-ending">The Ironic Ending</h2>
<p>I started this conversation wanting to write about my productivity problems. I ended up actually solving them.</p>
<p>The blog post was supposed to be about the problem. Instead, it became about the solution.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is have a better conversation.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I spent four hours yesterday watching YouTube videos about productivity.</p>
<p>The irony wasn&rsquo;t lost on me. There I was, consuming content about being productive instead of actually being productive. But here&rsquo;s the thing - I wasn&rsquo;t just being lazy. I was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>I have too many interests that all matter to me. I love to code. There&rsquo;s something magical about writing text and making computers do things. I&rsquo;m supposed to be working on an iPadOS app for my wife.</p>
<p>I love cooking, which means meal planning and grocery shopping - two huge time sucks.</p>
<p>I like working out, though I rarely do it anymore.</p>
<p>Roleplaying games fascinate me. I want to set up the next adventure for friends.</p>
<p>My wife has her own projects that need my support. Then there&rsquo;s my reading backlog - books, stories, technical manuals.</p>
<p>Oh, and I spend twelve hours a week getting dialysis.</p>
<h2 id="the-multi-interest-trap">The Multi-Interest Trap</h2>
<p>Most productivity advice assumes your interests are frivolous. &ldquo;Just eliminate the time-wasters,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;Focus on what matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what if everything matters?</p>
<p>Coding isn&rsquo;t just a hobby - it&rsquo;s creative problem-solving that feeds my soul. Cooking isn&rsquo;t just sustenance - it&rsquo;s how I care for my family. RPGs aren&rsquo;t escapism - they&rsquo;re collaborative storytelling that connects me with friends. Reading isn&rsquo;t procrastination - it&rsquo;s how I learn and grow.</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t having meaningless hobbies. The problem is having too many meaningful ones.</p>
<p>Traditional productivity gurus don&rsquo;t account for this. They assume you&rsquo;re scrolling TikTok for hours, not trying to choose between legitimate creative pursuits. When all your interests have value, choosing becomes paralyzing.</p>
<h2 id="the-chronic-illness-factor">The Chronic Illness Factor</h2>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the reality most productivity advice ignores completely: chronic illness.</p>
<p>I spend four hours, three days a week, lying in a bed with needles in my left arm. I can&rsquo;t move that arm. I can&rsquo;t use both hands. I&rsquo;m physically constrained in ways that make traditional &ldquo;hustle culture&rdquo; advice feel like a cruel joke.</p>
<p>My energy fluctuates wildly. Some afternoons after dialysis, I feel energetic. Other days, I&rsquo;m completely drained. The days between treatments are usually my most productive, but that&rsquo;s only four days a week at full capacity.</p>
<p>Most productivity experts have never had to plan their creative work around medical treatments. They&rsquo;ve never had to factor in recovery time or energy management. Their advice assumes consistent daily energy levels that simply don&rsquo;t exist for people like me.</p>
<h2 id="the-consumption-trap">The Consumption Trap</h2>
<p>This is where YouTube becomes dangerous.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re tired, when you&rsquo;re overwhelmed by choices, when you&rsquo;re physically limited, consumption becomes the path of least resistance. Watching someone else code feels productive without requiring the energy that actual coding demands. Food videos scratch the cooking itch without the meal planning overhead.</p>
<p>I recently watched a video that hit hard (see <a href="https://youtu.be/R4MInIP2c-A?si=rW29vhDlEfG-JAx7">The Habit that forces your brain to stop consuming</a>). The creator talked about how our brains crave novelty and dopamine, and social media provides artificial hits of both. But creation provides them in more sustainable, meaningful doses.</p>
<p>The insight was powerful: shift from being a consumer to being a contributor.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what the video didn&rsquo;t address - what happens when your ability to contribute is limited by physical constraints? What happens when you have the drive to create but not always the energy or physical capacity?</p>
<h2 id="adapted-strategies">Adapted Strategies</h2>
<p>The solution isn&rsquo;t to eliminate interests or ignore physical limitations. It&rsquo;s to work smarter with the energy and time you actually have.</p>
<p><strong>Work with your energy patterns, not against them.</strong> My most productive days are the in-between days. Instead of feeling guilty about low-energy days, I&rsquo;ve started planning for them. Dialysis days are for rest, planning, and light consumption that feeds future creation.</p>
<p><strong>Batch similar activities.</strong> Meal planning happens on Sundays. Coding happens in focused blocks on high-energy days. RPG prep gets batched with other reading activities.</p>
<p><strong>Combine interests strategically.</strong> What if I coded tools for my RPG campaigns? What if I built meal planning apps? What if I listened to coding podcasts while prepping ingredients?</p>
<p><strong>Make consumption serve creation.</strong> Instead of random YouTube videos, I queue up content that feeds my active projects. iOS development tutorials during dialysis recovery time. Cooking videos during meal planning sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Use constraints to make decisions.</strong> The physical limitation of one-handed iPad use during dialysis actually clarifies what activities are possible. The energy limitation of post-dialysis afternoons helps prioritize what matters most.</p>
<h2 id="its-not-about-choosing-less">It&rsquo;s Not About Choosing Less</h2>
<p>The traditional productivity advice of &ldquo;just focus on one thing&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t work when you&rsquo;re a creative person with multiple meaningful interests. And it definitely doesn&rsquo;t work when chronic illness adds layers of complexity to your energy management.</p>
<p>The real solution is learning to work with your constraints instead of fighting them. Your limitations aren&rsquo;t failures - they&rsquo;re data points that help you make better decisions about how to spend your energy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working on this. Some days I still end up in YouTube rabbit holes instead of making progress on projects that matter. But I&rsquo;m getting better at recognizing when that&rsquo;s happening and why.</p>
<p>The goal isn&rsquo;t perfect productivity. It&rsquo;s sustainable creativity within the reality of the life you actually have, not the life productivity gurus assume you&rsquo;re living.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is take a nap.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Let&rsquo;s be honest about something. How many D&amp;D campaigns have you started that never finished?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about those epic adventures that were supposed to take your characters from level 1 to 20. The ones that petered out somewhere around level 6. The campaign notes gathering dust on your hard drive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason for this. And it&rsquo;s not that your group lacks commitment.</p>
<h2 id="the-year-long-dd-commitment-problem">The Year-Long D&amp;D Commitment Problem</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what nobody tells you when you crack open that shiny new D&amp;D adventure book. <strong>Curse of Strahd</strong> will eat 22-26 sessions of your life. <strong>Tomb of Annihilation</strong> demands 26-35 sessions. Even the humble <strong>Lost Mines of Phandelver</strong> - the &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; adventure - clocks in at 30-50 hours of gameplay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 6 months to 2 years of regular weekly sessions. For <em>one</em> campaign.</p>
<p>Think about your last group text trying to schedule a session. Now imagine doing that every week for two years straight. While keeping the same characters alive. And remembering what happened in session 12 when you&rsquo;re now on session 31.</p>
<p>No wonder most D&amp;D campaigns die a slow death around the third month.</p>
<h2 id="coc-complete-stories-in-bite-sized-chunks">CoC: Complete Stories in Bite-Sized Chunks</h2>
<p>Call of Cthulhu takes a completely different approach. Most scenarios are designed to wrap up in 3-4 hours total.</p>
<p>Not 3-4 hours per session for months on end. Three to four hours. Period. Done. Complete story with beginning, middle, and satisfying conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The Haunting&rdquo;</strong> - the classic starter scenario - takes about 4-6 hours. You can literally run this on a Saturday afternoon and have investigators discover cosmic horror, face an impossible choice, and either save the day or go insane trying. All before dinner.</p>
<p>Compare that to starting <strong>Curse of Strahd</strong> knowing you&rsquo;re signing up for half a year of consistent scheduling. Which one sounds more doable for your actual life?</p>
<h2 id="why-dd-became-a-commitment-sport">Why D&amp;D Became a Commitment Sport</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. D&amp;D&rsquo;s design isn&rsquo;t accidental. The level 1-20 progression system demands long story arcs. You need time to grow from &ldquo;I swing my sword&rdquo; to &ldquo;I cast Meteor Swarm and reshape the battlefield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Published D&amp;D adventures are built around this. They&rsquo;re designed as months-long investments. Epic journeys that require sustained character development and party dynamics.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing. Somewhere along the way, the hobby developed this expectation that &ldquo;real&rdquo; D&amp;D means year-long campaigns. That shorter adventures are just warm-ups for the main event.</p>
<p>This turned D&amp;D into a commitment sport. Like training for a marathon when you just wanted to go for a jog.</p>
<h2 id="the-beautiful-efficiency-of-horror">The Beautiful Efficiency of Horror</h2>
<p>Call of Cthulhu works differently because horror works differently.</p>
<p>Investigation has a natural story structure. Investigators find clues. Clues lead to revelations. Revelations lead to confrontation with cosmic horror. Confrontation leads to resolution (or madness).</p>
<p>This arc fits perfectly into 3-4 hours. The tension builds, reaches a climax, and resolves. No need for seventeen sessions of character development. The story is the star, not the character sheet.</p>
<p>Plus, let&rsquo;s talk about character mortality. In CoC, investigators die. Or go insane. Or both. This isn&rsquo;t a bug - it&rsquo;s a feature. It creates natural endpoints to stories.</p>
<p>Unlike D&amp;D, where characters grow stronger and more attached over dozens of sessions, CoC investigators are fragile. This makes shorter commitments not just possible, but inevitable.</p>
<h2 id="real-talk-what-this-means-for-your-gaming-group">Real Talk: What This Means for Your Gaming Group</h2>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s great about running <strong>&ldquo;The Haunting&rdquo;</strong> on a Saturday night? Everyone leaves satisfied. Complete story. Full experience. No cliffhangers requiring next week&rsquo;s session to resolve.</p>
<p>Compare that to starting <strong>Descent into Avernus</strong> and knowing you&rsquo;re committing to 30-40 sessions. That&rsquo;s almost a year of weekly gaming. Miss a few sessions and you&rsquo;re lost. Have one player move away and the whole campaign crumbles.</p>
<p>CoC scenarios are perfect for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Groups with busy schedules</li>
<li>Players who want variety in their gaming</li>
<li>Anyone who&rsquo;s tired of unfinished campaigns</li>
<li>New players who don&rsquo;t want to commit to months of sessions</li>
</ul>
<p>You can run <strong>&ldquo;The Dead Boarder&rdquo;</strong> in 2 hours. <strong>&ldquo;The Necropolis&rdquo;</strong> takes 1-2 hours max. These aren&rsquo;t abbreviated experiences - they&rsquo;re complete horror stories with full narrative arcs.</p>
<h2 id="ready-to-try-some-cosmic-horror">Ready to Try Some Cosmic Horror?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re tired of D&amp;D campaigns that never reach their conclusions, give Call of Cthulhu a shot.</p>
<p>Start with <strong>&ldquo;The Haunting&rdquo;</strong> from the starter set. Four hours. Complete experience. Your players will face cosmic horror, make impossible choices, and either triumph or face the consequences of meddling with forces beyond human comprehension.</p>
<p>All in one evening.</p>
<p>The best part? When it&rsquo;s over, it&rsquo;s actually over. Your group will have experienced a complete story from beginning to end. No scheduling next week&rsquo;s session to find out what happens. No wondering if this campaign will join the graveyard of unfinished adventures.</p>
<p>Just the satisfaction of a story well told. And maybe, just maybe, investigators who lived to tell the tale.</p>
<p><em>Though honestly, where&rsquo;s the fun in that?</em></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After my kidney surgery, everything changed. I had to switch from peritoneal dialysis (PD) to hemodialysis (HD). PD is the type where you dialyze at home through your abdomen. HD is what most people picture - sitting in a clinic hooked to a machine.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a choice in this. The surgery made the decision for me.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-miss-most-about-pd">What I Miss Most About PD</h2>
<p>I miss my nights. With PD, I just hooked up before bed. The machine worked while I slept. Eight hours of gentle, continuous cleaning. No alarms, no nurses, no commute.</p>
<p>I could roll over. I could get up for water. I could live.</p>
<p>Now that freedom is gone. PD was like a gentle stream cleaning my blood all night. HD feels like a pressure washer blasting through me. Both work, but one lets you forget you&rsquo;re sick.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-ultrafiltration">Understanding Ultrafiltration</h2>
<p>Let me explain ultrafiltration. It&rsquo;s just a fancy word for removing extra fluid. Your kidneys normally do this when you pee. Dialysis has to do it artificially.</p>
<p>With PD, I could remove about twice as much fluid. The peritoneum - that&rsquo;s your abdominal lining - acts like a filter. Glucose in the dialysis fluid pulls water from your blood. It&rsquo;s osmosis, really.</p>
<p>HD uses pressure instead. It forces fluid out through an artificial membrane. It works, but there&rsquo;s a limit. Push too hard and you cramp. Your blood pressure drops. You feel awful.</p>
<h2 id="the-hd-reality">The HD Reality</h2>
<p>Four hours. That&rsquo;s what HD demands from me. Four hours of complete stillness every two days.</p>
<p>Try lying perfectly still for four hours. Your arm with the needles can&rsquo;t move. One wrong shift and alarms scream. Blood might leak. The nurses rush over.</p>
<p>My back aches after two hours. My legs want to stretch. My mind goes crazy with boredom. I watch the clock like it&rsquo;s my enemy.</p>
<p>Some people sleep through it. I can&rsquo;t. I just lie there, waiting.</p>
<h2 id="what-hd-does-better">What HD Does Better</h2>
<p>I have to be fair here. HD removes phosphate and potassium like a champion. These minerals build up when your kidneys fail. Too much potassium stops your heart. Too much phosphate destroys your bones.</p>
<p>HD clears them efficiently. Three times a week, boom - levels drop. With PD, it was always a struggle. I took binders with every meal. I avoided certain foods.</p>
<p>So yes, HD has its advantages. But at what cost?</p>
<h2 id="the-trade-off-id-make">The Trade-Off I&rsquo;d Make</h2>
<p>Give me back my PD tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll take the phosphate binders. I&rsquo;ll skip the bananas and potatoes. I&rsquo;ll manage the potassium myself.</p>
<p>What good is efficient toxin removal if it steals your life? I&rsquo;d rather have good days with some dietary restrictions. HD gives me perfect labs and exhausting treatment days.</p>
<p>Quality of life matters. Being able to work matters. Traveling without planning around clinics matters. Sleeping in your own bed every night matters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d make that trade in a heartbeat.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>My doctors say I might return to PD eventually. The surgical site needs to heal completely first. I&rsquo;m counting the days.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re choosing between PD and HD, think beyond the medical numbers. Consider your lifestyle. Value your independence. Ask about all your options.</p>
<p>HD works well for many people. Some prefer the structure. Some like not managing their own care. That&rsquo;s valid too.</p>
<p>But for me? I just want my nights back. I want to wake up dialyzed, not exhausted. I want treatment that fits my life, not life that fits my treatment.</p>
<p>Until then, I&rsquo;ll endure my four-hour sessions. I&rsquo;ll appreciate what HD does well. But I&rsquo;ll keep hoping for the day I can go home again.</p>

			 <p>Ever wondered what George Washington really looked like? Not the stiff painting version, but the actual person?</p>
<p>What if you could see Marie Curie&rsquo;s actual face? Not just that famous black-and-white photo. Her real, living face with all its expressions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what <a href="https://youtube.com/@relaxhistoryai?si=eBPLAHoD6LA1_cy1">Relax History AI</a> does. And it&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-relax-history-ai">What is Relax History AI?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a YouTube channel that brings dead people back to life. Well, sort of.</p>
<p>They use AI to transform old paintings and descriptions into photorealistic faces. Suddenly, historical figures aren&rsquo;t just names in textbooks. They&rsquo;re people. Real people with eyes that seem to look right at you.</p>
<p>The channel creates videos that reimagine everyone from Geronimo to Anastasia Romanov. Each face tells a story. Each image makes history feel closer.</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-behind-the-screen">The Magic Behind the Screen</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works. The AI analyzes everything available about a historical figure. Paintings, sketches, written descriptions. Even details about their ethnicity and the time period.</p>
<p>Then it creates what they probably looked like. Not cartoon versions. Not idealized portraits. Just people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like time travel without the paradoxes.</p>
<p>The technology adds subtle details too. Skin texture, natural lighting, realistic hair. These aren&rsquo;t Instagram filters. This is serious reconstruction work.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-is-a-brilliant-use-of-ai">Why This is a Brilliant Use of AI</h2>
<p>Most AI applications feel cold. This one creates connection.</p>
<p>Think about it. We learn history through dusty portraits and formal paintings. Everyone looks stern. Everyone looks distant. No wonder kids find history boring.</p>
<p>But show them what Cleopatra might have really looked like? Now you&rsquo;ve got their attention.</p>
<p>This democratizes history in ways textbooks never could. You don&rsquo;t need a PhD to feel connected to these figures. You just need eyes and curiosity.</p>
<p>It also preserves cultural memory differently. Not through static images. Through faces that feel alive.</p>
<h2 id="hit-series-that-changed-everything">Hit Series That Changed Everything</h2>
<p>Their &ldquo;20 Historical Icons Brought Back to Life&rdquo; series went viral. For good reason.</p>
<p>Each episode features multiple historical figures. George Washington looks less like a dollar bill and more like your stern grandfather. Anastasia Romanov becomes a real teenager, not just a tragic legend.</p>
<p>Marie Curie? She looks brilliant and tired. Exactly how you&rsquo;d expect someone who discovered radium to look.</p>
<p>Geronimo stares back with intensity that no painting captured. You understand why he was such a formidable leader.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t just pictures. They&rsquo;re windows into real lives.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-learning-history">The Future of Learning History</h2>
<p>This is what good AI looks like. It doesn&rsquo;t replace human connection. It creates it.</p>
<p>Imagine history classes using this technology. Students could &ldquo;meet&rdquo; the people they&rsquo;re studying. The American Revolution becomes less abstract when you can see Washington&rsquo;s actual face.</p>
<p>Teachers could show that historical figures were just people. They had bad hair days. They had worry lines. They looked tired sometimes.</p>
<p>It changes everything about how we relate to the past.</p>
<h2 id="some-final-thoughts">Some Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Sure, these reconstructions aren&rsquo;t perfect. We can&rsquo;t know exactly what these people looked like. But that&rsquo;s not really the point.</p>
<p>The point is connection. The point is making history human again.</p>
<p>When you see Cleopatra as a real person, not just an Elizabeth Taylor movie, something shifts. History stops being about dates and starts being about people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real magic here. Not the AI technology itself. But what it helps us see.</p>
<p>Dead people were once alive. They had faces. They had expressions. They were just like us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what makes <a href="https://youtube.com/@relaxhistoryai?si=eBPLAHoD6LA1_cy1">Relax History AI</a> such a great use of artificial intelligence. It makes the artificial feel human.</p>

			 <h3 id="trump-always-chickens-out---a-spicy-new-internet-sensation"><em>Trump Always Chickens Out</em> - A Spicy New Internet Sensation</h3>
<p>It seems the internet has found its newest obsession, and surprisingly, it involves both politics and Mexican cuisine ‚Äì sort of. The acronym &ldquo;TACO&rdquo; has been taking over Facebook feeds faster than you can say &ldquo;guacamole,&rdquo; but this particular taco comes with an extra side of political satire.</p>
<p>TACO stands for &ldquo;Trump Always Chickens Out,&rdquo; a term originally coined by a Financial Times columnist that has now morphed into a full-blown meme phenomenon. The internet, being the internet, couldn&rsquo;t resist the delicious wordplay opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="why-taco-is-on-the-menu">Why TACO is on the Menu</h3>
<p>Like any good taco, this meme comes with layers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Shell</strong>: A crispy exterior of seemingly tough talk</li>
<li><strong>The Filling</strong>: A soft interior of policy reversals and backtracking</li>
<li><strong>The Hot Sauce</strong>: Added spice when Trump himself reacted to a reporter&rsquo;s &ldquo;nasty&rdquo; question about it</li>
</ol>
<p>The beauty of the TACO meme is that it&rsquo;s both a noun and a verb. &ldquo;Did you see Trump TACO on that trade policy again?&rdquo; has become the new way to describe someone who talks tough but retreats when challenged.</p>
<h3 id="from-drive-thru-to-viral-drive">From Drive-Thru to Viral Drive</h3>
<p>What makes this political fast food so addictive? Perhaps it&rsquo;s the perfect combination of simplicity and substance. In a world of complex political discourse, sometimes all you need is a simple acronym that people can sink their teeth into.</p>
<p>As one Facebook user eloquently put it: &ldquo;I used to enjoy Taco Tuesday, but now I enjoy TACO every day of the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever your political appetite, you have to admire the internet&rsquo;s ability to wrap complex political commentary in a convenient, hand-held meme format. It&rsquo;s political fast food for the digital age ‚Äì quick, satisfying, and guaranteed to leave a lasting impression.</p>
<p><em>Just remember, unlike actual tacos, this one seems to have no problem holding everything together.</em></p>

			 <h2 id="when-bromance-meets-reality-tv-drama-in-the-age-of-electric-vehicles">When Bromance Meets Reality TV Drama in the Age of Electric Vehicles</h2>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>In what future historians will surely call &ldquo;The Most 2025 Thing Ever,&rdquo; the Trump-Musk friendship has imploded more spectacularly than a SpaceX test rocket. Grab your popcorn, folks ‚Äì this billionaire breakup has everything: Tesla tantrums, Twitter tirades, and stock market drama.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-rise-and-fall-of-an-unlikely-bromance">The Rise and Fall of an Unlikely Bromance</h2>
<p>Remember when Trump and Musk were the dynamic duo nobody saw coming? It feels like yesterday they were finishing each other&rsquo;s tweets and making government efficiency memes together. But as we&rsquo;ve learned from every reality TV show ever (and Trump should know this better than anyone), alliances built on shared enemies rarely survive success.</p>
<p>The partnership that began with such promise ‚Äì Musk heading up the Department of Government Efficiency (yes, DOGE, because apparently we&rsquo;re living in a simulation programmed by memelords) ‚Äì has now devolved into a public spat that makes celebrity divorces look like amicable conscious uncouplings.</p>
<h2 id="the-tesla-tantrum-that-broke-the-internet">The Tesla Tantrum That Broke the Internet</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Breaking:</strong> Man who bought $100,000+ friendship token now considering regifting it. More at 11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In what might be the most expensive &ldquo;take back&rdquo; in friendship history, Trump is reportedly considering selling or giving away the red Tesla he purchased earlier this year to support Musk. It&rsquo;s like returning a friendship bracelet, but with a six-figure price tag and autopilot features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Trump saying Musk has &lsquo;lost his mind&rsquo; is particularly rich, considering both men are known for their&hellip; let&rsquo;s say &lsquo;unconventional&rsquo; social media presence.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-irony-olympics-gold-medal-moments">The Irony Olympics: Gold Medal Moments</h2>
<h3 id="1-the-doge-disaster-">1. The DOGE Disaster üêï</h3>
<p>Musk&rsquo;s Department of Government Efficiency was supposed to streamline government operations. Instead, it seems to have streamlined the path to their friendship&rsquo;s demise. The irony is so thick you could cut it with a Cybertruck&rsquo;s angular edges.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-lost-his-mind-proclamation-">2. The &ldquo;Lost His Mind&rdquo; Proclamation ü§Ø</h3>
<p>Trump declaring that someone else has &ldquo;lost their mind&rdquo; is like a fish complaining about someone being wet. The pot hasn&rsquo;t just met the kettle; they&rsquo;re having a full-blown Twitter war.</p>
<h3 id="3-the-stock-market-side-eye-">3. The Stock Market Side-Eye üìâ</h3>
<p>Tesla shares dropping 14% during their feud is essentially Wall Street&rsquo;s way of saying, &ldquo;Can you two just get along? Some of us have retirement portfolios!&rdquo; The market has spoken, and it&rsquo;s begging for couple&rsquo;s therapy.</p>
<hr>
<p>üí° <strong>Fun Fact: The Timeline of Doom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early 2025:</strong> Trump buys red Tesla, friendship rings exchanged (metaphorically)</li>
<li><strong>Spring 2025:</strong> DOGE launches, memes abound, efficiency promised</li>
<li><strong>June 2025:</strong> Public feud erupts, accusations fly, Tesla considered for donation</li>
<li><strong>Future:</strong> Netflix documentary inevitable</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-the-rest-of-us-mortals">What This Means for the Rest of Us Mortals</h2>
<p>Beyond the entertainment value (which, let&rsquo;s be honest, is substantial), this feud represents something more significant: the collision of tech billionaire culture with political reality TV drama. It&rsquo;s what happens when you mix Silicon Valley&rsquo;s &ldquo;move fast and break things&rdquo; with Washington&rsquo;s &ldquo;tweet fast and break relationships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The implications are real:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tesla stockholders are getting a masterclass in why company valuations shouldn&rsquo;t depend on CEO friendships</li>
<li>Government efficiency efforts are learning that you can&rsquo;t DOGE your way out of personality conflicts</li>
<li>Twitter (or X, or whatever we&rsquo;re calling it these days) is getting record engagement from rubberneckers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-silver-lining-comedy-gold">The Silver Lining: Comedy Gold</h2>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing we can count on in 2025, it&rsquo;s that when two of the world&rsquo;s most powerful and controversial figures have a public falling out, the memes will be legendary. From Tesla return policies to DOGE efficiency jokes, the internet has been feasting on this drama like it&rsquo;s a unlimited buffet of absurdity.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>The Trump-Musk feud of 2025 will go down in history as either the moment when billionaire bromances jumped the shark, or the greatest reality TV crossover event of all time. Either way, we&rsquo;re all watching, tweeting, and wondering if this is what peak 2025 looks like.</p>
<p>As for Trump&rsquo;s red Tesla? Maybe it&rsquo;ll end up in a museum someday, with a plaque reading: &ldquo;Artifact from the Great Billionaire Breakup of 2025 ‚Äì Handle with Care, May Contain Traces of Irony.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Let‚Äôs see where this goes. In the meantime, maybe check your Tesla stock holdings. Just saying.</strong> üöóüíîüì±</p>

The only thing that kind of works is walking from the bedroom to the couch. I just went for a walk with my son as safety person. I wanted to see how far I get. The goal was to walk once around the block. I got around the corner (which is right next to our house by the way) and then gave up two houses down. This is still quite a long way to recovery.</p>

<p>These hospital stays are grinding me down. I‚Äôve hit the point where the balance has shifted from healing and getting better to getting worse due to hospital related things. Too much lying in bed, getting poked too much and in wrong way leading to hematoma, dealing with people that should know what they are doing, but clearly don‚Äôt.</p>

<p>√úberblick:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Die Pflege steht an einem politischen Scheidepunkt: Die Bundestagswahl 2025 er√∂ffnet die Chance zu einer nachhaltigen Sicherung der Pflege im Interesse von Millionen Pflegebed√ºrftigen und ihren Angeh√∂rigen. Deshalb fordern wir die demokratischen Parteien auf, eine umfassende Pflegereform zu einem der zentralen Vorhaben in ihren Wahlprogrammen zu machen ‚Äì und in der n√§chsten Bundesregierung ernsthaft umzusetzen.</p>
<p>Unsere Forderungen ‚Äì eine umfassende Pflegereform muss folgende Punkte beinhalten:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pflegende Angeh√∂rige absichern: Pflegende Angeh√∂rige m√ºssen wirtschaftlich, auch im Rentenalter, besser abgesichert werden. Das kann durch Ma√ünahmen wie eine Lohnersatzleistung und zus√§tzliche Rentenpunkte erreicht werden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pflegebed√ºrftige und ihre Angeh√∂rigen unterst√ºtzen: Der Zugang zu Leistungen der Pflegeversicherung muss √ºbersichtlicher und einfacher werden. Auch so k√∂nnen die An- und Zugeh√∂rigen vor √úberlastung gesch√ºtzt werden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finanzierung sichern: Alle Menschen m√ºssen sich gute Pflege leisten und daf√ºr berechenbare Eigenvorsorge treffen k√∂nnen. Durch eine Pflege-Vollversicherung statt der heutigen ‚ÄûTeilkasko‚Äú m√ºssen Pflegebed√ºrftige vor unw√§gbaren finanziellen Risiken gesch√ºtzt werden.</p>
</li>
</ol>

			 <p>After reading about <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/github-spark">GitHub Spark</a> I felt inspired to see how good programming with an AI works.</p>
<p>So I set about using <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude/haiku">Claude 3.5 Haiku</a> to write a little Python program that archives a give URL as PDF, Markdown and saves a bunch of metadata along as well as summarizes the page with GPT4.</p>
<p>It took a bit of noodling and back an forth with the AI to smooth out the functionality and the errors I got. But I didn‚Äòt code anything myself. Only copied and pasted a few code corrections here and there that the AI gave me.</p>
<p>And it works. I think I will continue on this path and make my own version of <a href="https://archivebox.io">Archivebox</a>.</p>

			 <p>John Gruber in his piece <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/17/dhh-argues-against-passkeys">DHH Argues Against Passkeys</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, I really dislike the practice of replacing passwords with email ‚Äúmagic links‚Äù. Autofilling a password from my keychain happens instantly; getting a magic link from email can take minutes sometimes, and even in the fastest case, it‚Äôs nowhere near instantaneous. Replacing something very fast ‚Äî password autofill ‚Äî with something slower is just a terrible idea. For people who actually prefer email magic links, it‚Äôs fine as an option, but it shouldn‚Äôt be the default, and it certainly shouldn‚Äôt be the only way to sign into an account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to agree. Magic links are more annoying then helpful. I‚Äòd like them to be an option and not the norm. I‚Äòve had more then one occasion where I had to trigger a magic link several times before it arrived in my inbox. A simple email/password login would have been much more reliable and quicker.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am leaving for our gymnasium reunion in two days. I haven&rsquo;t seen any of my old school friends in at least ten years. I&rsquo;ve never been much of a social person; while I enjoy the company of friends, I&rsquo;m not particularly good at keeping in touch.</p>
<p>So, I am essentially meeting a bunch of strangers in four days. I&rsquo;m not very good at social gatherings where I don&rsquo;t know anyone, so I&rsquo;m unsure how I feel about the reunion. On one hand, I&rsquo;m looking forward to it; on the other, I&rsquo;m really dreading it.</p>
<p>My health situation doesn&rsquo;t help to make me feel less awkward. Having a stiff neck that is locked at an angle, making my most comfortable stance one that looks at people&rsquo;s crotches, is, well, suboptimal.</p>

			 <p>I thought I‚Äôd write down my current workflow setup since it has changed drastically since I last wrote about it. Not only am I exclusively working from home these days‚Äîdue to health reasons‚Äîbut I am also working in a very reduced capacity. This means I am mostly using my iPhone, iPad, and iMac for leisure.</p>
<p>With that being said, here is what I use on a daily basis.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-up-with-the-joneses">Keeping up with the Joneses</h2>
<h3 id="microblog">Micro.blog</h3>
<p>I said goodbye to social media a while ago. While I was quite active on Twitter and even more so on App.net and Slack, I have since dropped all of these. There really isn&rsquo;t much point in spinning my wheels there.</p>
<p>These days, I post to my own blog, which is syndicated to the Micro.blog timeline and also cross-posted to Mastodon. I&rsquo;m not active on Mastodon, but thanks to the Fediverse, any replies I receive on Mastodon should appear on my Micro.blog timeline.</p>
<p>Posting to my blog is done via the Micro.blog app or website, which is very frictionless for the most part.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <a href="https://micro.blog/AlexKucera">Micro.blog Account</a></li>
<li>My <a href="https://alexanderkucera.com">website</a></li>
<li>My Fediverse ID: <a href="@alex@alexanderkucera.com">@alex@alexanderkucera.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fiery-feeds-and-feedbin">Fiery Feeds and FeedBin</h3>
<p>For my daily news, I tend to watch the local news show <a href="https://youtube.com/@tagesschau?si=DNoE4UhebBbcOiOz">Tagesthemen</a> while eating breakfast. This keeps me up to date on both local and global news and politics.</p>
<p>For my tech news and other updates, I use <a href="https://feedbin.com/home">Feedbin</a> to curate my feeds and <a href="https://voidstern.net/fiery-feeds">Fiery Feeds</a> for reading them. Fiery Feeds has a few nice intelligent curation options, like Hot Links or Long and Short articles, that make it easy to catch up on too many RSS feeds every day. Yes, maybe I should subscribe to fewer feeds, but with Fiery Feeds, I really don‚Äôt have to.</p>
<h3 id="overcast">Overcast</h3>
<p>Every couple of years, I switch podcast apps. I used to be an avid user of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/pocket-casts-podcast-player/id414834813">Pocket Casts</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241">Castro</a> was my favorite player for years. These days, I am back with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/overcast/id888422857">Overcast</a>. I don‚Äôt have any special feelings for it; it works well.</p>
<h3 id="youtube">YouTube</h3>
<p>Sadly, I am a sucker for YouTube videos. I do not browse the auto-suggestions much, but I have way too many subscriptions. At the moment, my ‚ÄûWatch Later‚Äú queue contains 24 items, most of which are in the 20-30 minute range. However, there are a few videos that are 1.5-3 hours long that I haven‚Äôt gotten around to watching.</p>
<h3 id="discord">Discord</h3>
<p>While I don‚Äôt engage much on Discord, I follow a few servers to get news announcements and participate in one or two in-person chats. The days when I was active daily for several hours on Slack and Discord are long gone.</p>
<h2 id="health-related">Health related</h2>
<h3 id="macrofactor">MacroFactor</h3>
<p>I recently started using <a href="https://macrofactorapp.com/">MacroFactor</a> to track my food and water intake. I have been on and off the food-tracking wagon in the past; usually, I track for a week or two before stopping again. The apps I have used in the past, like Lifesum and MyFitnessPal, are all nice and work reasonably well with tracking EU foods. However, they all miss a crucial element: they don‚Äôt adapt to one‚Äôs personal habits; they simply track food.</p>
<p>MacroFactor, on the other hand, adapts to your eating habits, providing you with tailored goals and occasionally coaching you on what you can improve or change. It simply clicks with me much more than all the other apps I have tried.</p>
<h3 id="rp-hypertrophy">RP Hypertrophy</h3>
<p>About a year ago, I finally accepted that I needed to build some strength to get my life back. Due to severe health-related issues, I pretty much stopped moving around 2016. I didn‚Äôt blow up, but I lost nearly all my muscle. Moving around the house became a chore at times. Combined with some serious joint inflammation, this kept me sedentary.</p>
<p>No more. I started slowly to build muscle again. At first, I went too quickly, which resulted in weeks of not being able to work out due to inflamed joints. However, in combination with MacroFactor, I have been able to manage my food intake in a way that reduces inflammation while providing enough protein and energy to rebuild my strength.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rpstrength.com/pages/hypertrophy-app">RP Hypertrophy</a> app has been my steadfast companion. There are other exercise apps out there‚Äîsome cheaper, some more expensive, and some even free‚Äîbut none of them resonate with me like the RP Hypertrophy app does. The way it allows me to quickly set up a training plan is unparalleled. It also helps me with my progression by analyzing my workout volume. Great! One less thing to think about.</p>
<p>RP Strength also has a <a href="https://rpstrength.com/pages/diet-coach-app">Diet Coach</a> app, but for me, MacroFactor works better.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<h3 id="paper">Paper</h3>
<p>I recently stumbled across <a href="https://papereditor.app">Paper</a> as a writing tool, and I really, really like it. I haven‚Äôt quite found the justification to pay for it yet. It comes with a hefty price tag in my region (the developer consciously charges more in richer regions of the world). However, I might consider it in the future, depending on whether I start writing professionally again in the coming months. For now, I‚Äôm going the cheapskate route and clicking away the nag screens that pop up now and again. Sorry, <a href="https://twitter.com/_mihhail">Mihhail</a>!</p>
<h3 id="textastic">Textastic</h3>
<p>I don‚Äôt use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/textastic-code-editor/id1049254261">Textastic</a> for actual writing, but it is a great general text editor if I need to edit something from my iCloud, modify a file on my server, or whip up a quick Python script or other scripts.</p>
<h3 id="airmail">AirMail</h3>
<p>My email client of choice is <a href="https://airmailapp.com">AirMail</a>. There‚Äôs not much to say about it, really. It works for me.</p>
<h2 id="apps-by-readdle">Apps by Readdle</h2>
<p>I use several apps from the Ukrainian developer <a href="https://readdle.com/">Readdle</a>. They tend to deliver a polished experience, and their support is excellent.</p>
<h3 id="calendars">Calendars</h3>
<p>Their <a href="https://readdle.com/calendars">calendar solution</a> is top-notch. It supports natural language event creation, the UI is nice, and it works better for me than the native Calendar app on iOS.</p>
<h3 id="scanner">Scanner</h3>
<p>Their <a href="https://readdle.com/scannerpro">document scanner</a> works in a very no-nonsense way. It offers great support for de-skewing and straightening out your wonky document photos. It provides automatic OCR and document naming, and you can create workflows‚Äîsomething I haven‚Äôt taken advantage of yet, as my needs aren‚Äôt that complex.</p>
<h3 id="pdf-expert">PDF Expert</h3>
<p>Their <a href="https://pdfexpert.com">PDF reader</a> works great. You can edit and annotate PDFs. Sadly, there is no OCR on iOS or iPadOS yet, but I am told it‚Äôs coming.</p>
<h2 id="strongbox">Strongbox</h2>
<p>I used to be a strong <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> supporter. I bought it way back when I got my first iPhone‚Äîan iPhone 4. Since then, I have bought several updates, and when they switched to a subscription model, I purchased the family plan for‚ÄîI think‚Äîtwo years.</p>
<p>Then I read a thread on Micro.blog where someone talked about <a href="https://strongboxsafe.com/">Strongbox</a>. I checked it out, installed it, and took advantage of their very generous three-month trial. After a week or so of use, they had won me over, and I happily paid for their lifetime license after the trial period was over.</p>
<p>Granted, using Strongbox is a little bit more complicated and less streamlined than using 1Password, but their lifetime license costs what I used to pay for 1Password in a year. There is simply no comparison when it comes to value per euro.</p>
<h2 id="ai">AI</h2>
<h3 id="perplexity">Perplexity</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai">Perplexity</a> for searching most of the time instead of doing a Google or DuckDuckGo search. I enjoy getting nicely written summarized results, and if I want to dig deeper, I can simply open the sources Perplexity found for a given topic. I haven‚Äôt found any instances where the AI hallucinated an answer, but there have been a few occasions where the suggested follow-up questions were just nonsense.</p>
<h3 id="typingmind">TypingMind</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.typingmind.com">TypingMind</a> is a great ChatGPT interface that allows me to use most ChatGPT  features without shelling out over $20 a month. It connects via the ChatGPT API, which results in much more reasonable costs. I got myself a premium license and haven‚Äôt looked back since.</p>
<h3 id="midjourney">MidJourney</h3>
<p>Generative Imaging. Some people loathe it; I personally love it. <a href="https://www.midjourney.com">MidJourney</a> is great for quickly generating dozens of variations on an idea, especially since they enabled generation via the website instead of in a Discord chat. We have used it to rapidly create initial drafts and, yes, even final designs for projects, both professional and private.</p>
<h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>
<h3 id="affinity-designer-2">Affinity Designer 2</h3>
<p>Since I have mostly stepped back from work, we primarily focus on occasional graphic design for local projects, such as flyers, postcards, roll-up flags, and the like.</p>
<p><a href="https://affinity.serif.com/designer/">Affinity Designer</a> is unbeatable in terms of price and the value it offers for this purpose. Additionally, we can use it on the iPad for initial mockups and then continue working on the same file on the Mac. Brilliant!</p>
<h3 id="affinity-photo-2">Affinity Photo 2</h3>
<p>It‚Äôs pixel-related brother, <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/photo/">Affinity Photo</a>, while not as intuitive and powerful as Photoshop, is still nevertheless our main go-to when it comes to editing images. Plus, it works well together with Designer and also offers the same iPad-to-Mac and back workflow.</p>
<h3 id="qr-factory">QR Factory</h3>
<p>Since we switched to a more graphic design-based workflow, we regularly need to create QR codes. While there are many online and free generators available, <a href="https://www.tunabellysoftware.com/qrfactory/">QR Factory</a> offers a comprehensive suite of QR options in one package. I wouldn‚Äôt consider using any other option anymore.</p>
<h3 id="nuke">Nuke</h3>
<p>Foundry‚Äôs <a href="https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke-family">Nuke</a> is my main workhorse for paid work. Although I don‚Äôt do as much as I once did, I am still very happy to pay for an Indie license when the occasional project comes in. Nuke remains the gold standard for compositing.</p>
<h3 id="modo">Modo</h3>
<p>Similarly, when I need to do some 3D work, I use my trusty copy of Foundry‚Äôs <a href="https://www.foundry.com/products/modo">modo</a>. It still gets me everywhere I need to go‚Äîthough these days, that isn‚Äôt very far.</p>
<h2 id="outbank">Outbank</h2>
<p>For banking in Germany, this is the way to go. <a href="https://outbankapp.com">Outbank</a> has the best banking support of any app I‚Äôve tried in the past. The developers had some negative press a couple of years ago related to pricing, subscriptions, and a completely revamped UI design, but I think they have recovered well from that.</p>
<p>For my money, this is the best way to keep track of your money, at least for European/German users.</p>
<h2 id="etsy-and-printful">Etsy and Printful</h2>
<p>I recently discovered <a href="www.printful.com/de/give-5-get-5/FO7BEA">Printful</a>, and it got me interested enough to open our own little <a href="https://bdscribblewear.etsy.com">Etsy store</a> with designs from the cutting room floor. I mean, why let perfectly good doodles and scribbles go to waste?‚Äú</p>
<h2 id="it">IT</h2>
<h3 id="fe-file-explorer">FE File Explorer</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.skyjos.com/fileexplorer/">FE File Explorer</a> is my go-to app when the Files app on iOS won‚Äôt suffice. It is also a great FTP client and integrates nicely with our online workflow.</p>
<h3 id="shellfish">ShellFish</h3>
<p><a href="https://secureshellfish.app">ShellFish</a> is my preferred SSH client. I have tried a few others in the past, but ShellFish has really stuck with me. It also integrates nicely with Files.app.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>So, I went to the dentist today to get a dental cleaning. My last dental cleaning was about six months ago, and the one before that was about three years prior. I was told last time that because the time between cleanings was so long, the cleaning took over an hour and that I should go more often.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I did. And guess what? The cleaning still took over an hour. Not only that, but there was a 50% price increase since last time.</p>
<p>50%!</p>
<p>I wish I could increase my rates by 50%. That is ten times the current inflation rate. Ridiculous. I think I‚Äôll take my chances and spread apart the cleanings to every other year again, because I do not see the value in getting this done every six months.</p>

			 <p>This is a test of the Bear app for writing and note taking. So it turns out Bear does not publish to Micro.blog. Also the writing environment is not nearly as neat as Paper, even when I hide all the UI.</p>
<p>One advantage Bear has is that is supports images and other file formats in the notes. However, since it does not publish to Micro.blog that is of no help there as I still need to upload first and then include the link to the media file.</p>
<p>This is an online image test:
<img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/239/2024/3158a76118.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And Bear seems to suffer from the same thing that plagues Bear. It does not export paragraphs properly. Or at least it treats paragraphs in the app differently then on export. A Markdown paragraph is denoted by a blank line between bodies of text. Both Paper and Bear show a simple line-break as new paragraph, but on export the paragraphs get lost due to no extra line break being added. Not terribly hard to work around, but worth noting.</p>
<p>But then again, Bear is about a third of the yearly cost. Which makes the choice actually harder and not easier.</p>

			 <p>This is a quick test about how the Paper app works. I recently read the <a href="https://havn.blog/2024/09/29/app-review-paper.html">Paper review</a> by Erlend on his Havn blog, which lead to me reading the terrific <a href="https://papereditor.app/dev">three part series</a> by the Paper developer on how Paper came together. It showed a level of care and detail that I highly appreciate.</p>
<p>So now here I am writing this in Paper and really enjoying the experience. I will compare this to Bear in another post. Both offer the ability to publish to Micro.blog as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Two paragraphs in and Paper already shines. But it does come with a hefty price tag. Considering I don‚Äòt write professionally, it is a bit of a hard pillow to shallow. Let‚Äòs see how it goes in Bear.</p>
<p>Now a quick image test:

			 <p>I tried the new Reeder app yesterday for about 20 minutes before deleting it again. It just didn‚Äôt fit my needs at all. Or maybe I simply didn‚Äôt get it.</p>
<p>The idea of an endless scrolling timeline stresses me out. No unread count. You mean there is no indication of it ever ending? That sounds stress inducing to no end.</p>
<p>With my RSS reader (the now called Reeder Classic), I have a ton of feeds that are very high frequency that I only scan to see if something pops out. I have a folder called favorites that I scan more closely. At the end I mark both the ‚Äûfirehose‚Äú and the favorites as read. The posts disappear and I am at ease that I got the most important bits.</p>
<p>Then I open YouTube take a quick glance at what the homepage suggests. Usually junk. If there is something interesting it goes into my watch later queue. Then I scan my subscriptions. Same deal. Done.</p>
<p>I do this once a days in the morning. Once.</p>
<p>During the day I catch up on my Micro.blog feed, which is easy, becausee I only follow a couple of people compared to several hundreds I followed on Twitter.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt need much morere then this. My past self probably would be all over Tapestry and the new Reeder. In fact, I did use a timeline aggregation app about ten years ago from Realmac Software that is no longer available and whose name I have forgotten. They were way ahead of their time back then. Maybe they should dust it off as well.</p>

			 <p>I find this whole Fediverse/Mastodon thing really confusing. For example, when trying to follow John Gruber, there are like 6 different accounts he has registered. Each of which seems to have different content. So am I supposed to have ten times the accounts I follow now just because everyone has a dozen different accounts spread over the internet?</p>

<p>This original, signed, and numbered drawing of Nosh by Dave Kellett deserves to be displayed, not left collecting dust. It&rsquo;s a piece that should shine on a wall or in a display case, but I no longer have the right space for it. With Dave&rsquo;s blessing, I‚Äôm offering it up for sale.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking to profit. These pieces usually go for around $100 on eBay. My only goal is to find a home where it‚Äôll be appreciated and displayed as it should be.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested, drop me a message on <a href="https://micro.blog/AlexKucera">Micro.blog</a> or email me at [a.kucera@babylondreams.de](mailto: <a href="mailto:a.kucera@babylondreams.de">a.kucera@babylondreams.de</a>) with an offer.

			 <p>I quit Twitter a little over a year ago officially. Similarly I haven‚Äòt used any of the other services like Facebook, LinkedIn, Mastodon, Slack, Skype or any of the others.</p>

<p>I don‚Äòt miss a thing. Social media can be intoxicating and make you feel like you miss a ton if you don‚Äòt constantly engage. This is a blatant lie you tell yourself. All you do is spinning your wheels while you could spend your time doing actually engaging or productive things.</p>

			 <p>My Foundry VTT journey continues. Last Tuesday we had our first session of Lost Mines of Phandelver and I promptly kill our party. It was a bit unbalanced due to only two of four players showing up and them insisting to pretend like the other party members didn‚Äôt exist.</p>
<p>But we all still had fun and they instantly proceeded to create new characters.</p>
<p>Also, I‚Äôm slowly‚Äîor actually rather fast‚Äîrunning out of server space with all the extra modules I‚Äôm installing. Uberspace by default gives you 10GB of disk space, most of which is taken up by my wife‚Äôs email account. She‚Äôs not great at inbox zero‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Anyway, you can book an extra 10GB for ‚Ç¨3 a month, which I did. But now I‚Äôm also running close to that limit thanks to some modules that require several GB of space. And now I‚Äôm pondering where it is worth the extra ‚Ç¨6 a month to self-host and the flexibility that brings or if I should buy access to The Forge for about ‚Ç¨4,50 a month and safe myself the headache.</p>

<p>They had me interested for a long time now and I finally took the plunge and am loving it. Their business model is quite unique in that it is ‚Äúpay what you want‚Äù. No strings attached.

<p>Their interface is mostly SSH shell based, so one better be somewhat Terminal skilled.</p>

			 <p>One thing I always wondered about game development: in order to make the game (and test the game) wouldn‚Äòt the game developer need to be the best player for the game as well? I mean, how do you make a super hard game without being able to play through and best the most difficult parts? Or come up with the hardest puzzles? Meaning game developers would need to be the best gamers as well?</p>

<p>Serves 4</p>
<p>Takes at least 3 hours, better more</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1¬†kg beef</li>
<li>800g onions</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic</li>
<li>1 teaspoon caraway</li>
<li>1 tablespoon marjoram</li>
<li>4 tablespoon paprika powder</li>
<li>1 tablespoon (white wine) vinegar</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon tomato paste</li>
<li>lard or sunflower seed oil</li>
<li>broth</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dice the onions into rough cubes.</li>
<li>Dice the beef into 2-4¬†cm cubes</li>
<li>Heat the lard/oil and fry the onions slowly to a dark brown. Don‚Äôt burn them!</li>
<li>Pur√©e the onions with a mixer or immersion blender</li>
<li>Add the cut up garlic, caraway, marjoram, paprika, and vinegar and mix well</li>
<li>add a bit of water and let it simmer for 1,5h to let the flavours develop</li>
<li>After the 1,5h is up, add the meat and fill with water or broth. The amount is a bit to taste. The meat should still be visible and not swim in water. Add too much and the sauce gets too thin, add too little and you can always thin it later.</li>
<li>Simmer for 3 hours or more on low heat. The longer, the better. In the end, you should have a nice deep red colour and a layer of fat swimming on the top.</li>
<li>Stir everything to mix in the fat.</li>
<li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best prepared the day before. Or even two days before. It gets better with every re-heating.</p>
<p>Eat with baguette, pasta or sp√§tzle. Some heathens eat it with rice.</p>

<p>Yesterday I came across one of the most German things I have seen in a long time. Apparently there is such a thing as an &ldquo;ArbeitsschutzgetraÃànk&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;worker protection drink&rdquo;. In essence it is an isotonic drink for workers in high heat work places. But I find it hilarious that we Germans felt the need to come up with a convoluted word for it.</p>

			 <p>To quote <a href="http://help.micro.blog/2015/why-i-created-this/">Manton Reece</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of you remember the earlier days of the web. If you wanted to write on the internet, you created a web site. You could publish essays, post photos, start weblogs.
‚Ä¶
Today, most writing instead goes into a small number of popular social networking sites.
‚Ä¶
I believe that even these short-form posts, no matter if they seem unimportant and fleeting at the time, still have an important place in the open web. That‚Äôs why I created Micro.blog. It focuses on short, recent posts, so I built that idea right into the name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And since I very much am in favor of owning your content my short posts (or snippets) live on my site now. They get syndicated to Twitter and Facebook, but the original content lives right here on my site. There is a separate <a href="http://blog.alexanderkucera.com/microblog/feed">RSS feed</a> for it so it doesn&rsquo;t pollute the main blog feed.</p>

			 <p>Any Git experts around? I am trying to modify the way my site gets updated. Right now I am using a <code>post-receive</code> hook to checkout the most recent commit. And that works great, but with the micro.blog iOS app I was thinking about using that for posting. Only problem is that this is not going to end up in my repo and is being overwritten with the post-receive hook every time I push something to the repo.</p>
<p>Right now I am using this hook:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#!/bin/sh
WEB_DIR=/home/user/public_html/pathtoblog

# remove any untracked files and directories
git --work-tree=${WEB_DIR} clean -fd

# force checkout of the latest deploy
git --work-tree=${WEB_DIR} checkout master --force
</code></pre><p>Is there a way to modify this so it does not clean <code>WEB_DIR</code> but instead commit/merge any changes from <code>WEB_DIR</code> before checkout?</p>

			 <p>A new series on compositing by yours truly just went live on pixelfondue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this new series on compositing we will look at the very basic techniques of compositing. How compositing works under the hood. So if you want to grow your compositing skills beyond simply pressing a bunch of buttons and hope that the result is worthwhile stick around.
I am going to work in Nuke, because it is very well suited for this ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù way of working as it exposes a lot of technical info in its UI already. However, the concepts work the same in any other compositing package like Fusion, After Effects, Photoshop, Blender or Natron. Please refer to your manual for equivalent functions.
If you want to follow along you can download the Nuke Non-Commercial edition.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="http://parfene.com/">Nick Parfene</a> over in the Indie Microblogging Slack asked me to write about my posting workflow and since I haven‚Äôt written about how I blog for <a href="http://blog.alexanderkucera.com/articles/blogging_workflow_again">over three years</a> it could do with an update.</p>
<h2 id="why-change">Why change?</h2>
<p>First, why change the previous workflow? I got confused. Simple as that. My blogging schedule is erratic at best. And the old run and gun style workflow, while working, always left me scratching my head when I hadn‚Äôt touched it for a few months. I know, months is a sad amount of idle time between posts. But it is what it is.</p>
<p>So to keep myself in the loop what happened to my blog I decided to adopt Git for keeping a publishing history. Not only does it allow me to tinker with the blog‚Äôs templates and CSS without messing up, it also serves as a nice automatic history what I did when and for what reason. I just need to read the commit log to job my memory.</p>
<h2 id="the-in-between-workflow">The in-between workflow</h2>
<p>The last workflow I wrote about three years ago relied on a desktop machine running. While I have a server machine running 24/7 I did experience too many hiccups with that approach to feel reliable. So I switched it to a two pronged process that worked pretty well. On the go I was posting with Workflow and Transmit and on the desktop I was using Hazel with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->custom Python script<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>This tended to work pretty well. Especially the on the go version. Write stuff in whatever text editor suits you best (I use <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/de/app/ulysses/id950335311?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%253D4">Ulysses</a>), send over to <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?">Workflow</a> for <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/b0364be085534bb8b94003de824f8d4d">processing</a> and upload to blog with <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/transmit-ios/id917432930?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%253D4">Transmit</a>. For images the procedure is similar only I use <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/42d6d670bbd940148a8e3c945682bc15">ImageOptim</a> or <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/a70ddd60f996477385a2d5d2d934fa60">Kraken</a> for image optimization before uploading. I use both at the moment and have not decided which one I like better.</p>
<h2 id="microblog-and-git">Micro.blog and Git</h2>
<p>Now, beginning of this year <a href="http://www.manton.org">Manton Reece</a> created a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing">Kickstarter project</a> about Microblogging (Kickstarter is over, but you can enter your details on a <a href="http://riverfold.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=241a0ce5d267c19de7fcf819f&amp;id=98f8896de4">mailing list</a> if you are interested in it). I found the idea enticing and so I joined the project. This basically got me fired up to tinker with my blog again, which led to the adoption of Git since I couldn‚Äôt make heads or tails of whatever my latest changes to it had been.</p>
<p>The idea is really quite simple. Git has the ability to run scripts, so called <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks">Hooks</a>, when certain events happen. In my case I use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/githooks.html">post-receive hook</a> to check out the newest version of my site whenever I push something to my server‚Äôs repository. There are a <a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/2012/03/push-code-remote-web-server-git/">number</a> of <a href="http://toroid.org/git-website-howto">guides</a> available, but the one I found most helpful was <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/simple-git-deployment-strategy-for-static-sites/">Nicolas Gallagher‚Äôs</a>.</p>
<p>Once that is set up the writing pipeline is really pretty similar to what I had above.</p>
<p>Write stuff in whatever text editor suits you best (I still use <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/de/app/ulysses/id950335311?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%253D4">Ulysses</a>), send over to <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?">Workflow</a> for <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/1eb4469c83b145c8867311bdcb9cd986">processing</a>, which then sends the article to <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-enterprise/id965019520?mt=8">Working Copy</a>, an iOS Git client. In Working Copy I can check and if necessary correct the post or snippet and then commit and push the changes to my Git repository on the server. There is gets immediately checked out to the live site. For images I still use <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/42d6d670bbd940148a8e3c945682bc15">ImageOptim</a> or <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/a70ddd60f996477385a2d5d2d934fa60">Kraken</a>.</p>
<p>The desktop version is almost the same really. I also use <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/de/app/ulysses/id623795237?mt=12&amp;ign-mpt=uo%253D4">Ulysses</a> for my desktop writing. From there I go via a custom <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alfred workflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that preps the article and then I push the changes up to my Git repository with <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/mac/">Tower</a>, but I could just as easily fire off a simple <code>git push</code> from Terminal.</p>

			 <p>My new Bluffworks Chinos just arrived and they are a great fit. Very comfortable to wear. The fabric is nicer on the skin then their regular travel pants and they feel a bit warmer as well, which is nice in the winter with temperatures of -10¬∞C. Overall I am a very happy customer if it weren‚Äôt for the horrendous import tax and the slow customs processing, none of which is Bluffworks‚Äô fault of course. But ‚Ç¨160 after customs for one pair of pants is not cheap to say it mildly. Anyway, I can highly recommend them and the regular travel pants for anyone who wants some good looking pants that are very easy to take care of, pack lightly and work great as travel, business and casual pants.</p>

			 <p>Mark Manson has an entertaining writing style and enough insight to make this book a fun and interesting read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be positive all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.
For decades we&rsquo;ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. &ldquo;F<em>ck positivity,&rdquo; Mark Manson says. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be honest, shit is f</em>cked, and we have to live with it.&rdquo; In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn&rsquo;t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is - a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F<em>ck is his antidote to the coddling, let&rsquo;s-all-feel-good mind-set that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.
Manson makes the argument, backed by both academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited - &ldquo;not everybody can be extraordinary; there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault&rdquo;. Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.
There are only so many things we can give a f</em>ck about, so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>back in 2009 I began pestering friends and random strangers. I would walk up to them with a pen and a sheet of paper asking that they immediately draw me a men‚Äôs bicycle, by heart. Soon I found out that when confronted with this odd request most people have a very hard time remembering exactly how a bike is made. Some did get close, some actually nailed it perfectly, but most ended up drawing something that was pretty  far off from a regular men‚Äôs bicycle.
Little I knew this is actually a test that psychologists use to demonstrate how our brain sometimes tricks us into thinking we know something even though we don‚Äôt.
I collected hundreds of drawings, building up a collection that I think is very precious. There is an incredible diversity of new typologies emerging from these crowd-sourced and technically error-driven drawings. A single designer could not invent so many new bike designs in 100 lifetimes and this is why  I look at this collection in such awe.</p>

<p>Such a great idea.</p>

			 <p>A great read that has me thinking about how to behave myself in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As it was in Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, and Othello, so it is in life. Most forms of private vice and public evil are kindled and sustained by lies. Acts of adultery and other personal betrayals, financial fraud, government corruption - even murder and genocide - generally require an additional moral defect: a willingness to lie.</p>
<p>In Lying, bestselling author and neuroscientist Sam Harris argues that we can radically simplify our lives and improve society by merely telling the truth in situations where others often lie. He focuses on &ldquo;white&rdquo; lies - those lies we tell for the purpose of sparing people discomfort - for these are the lies that most often tempt us. And they tend to be the only lies that good people tell while imagining that they are being good in the process.</p>

			 <p><em>This post also appeared as part of a longer article on <a href="http://www.fxguide.com/quicktakes/day-1-at-fmx-2015-rendering-and-20-years-of-weta-digital/">fxguide</a>.</em></p>
<p>Christophe took us on a journey through the history of Renderman. From the basics of RSL (Renderman Shading Language) with its empirical shading to RSL 2.0 and the first steps in physically plausible shading to the new <a href="http://www.fxguide.com/featured/rendermanris-and-the-start-of-next-25-years/">RIS</a> path tracing engine that allows physically accurate image creation.</p>
<p>We started with RSL 1.2, which basically was state of the art in big budget productions up to 2005. It had the hallmarks of traditional computer graphics: light sources without any size or falloff (in fact, ILM usually didn&rsquo;t use falloff on lights at all even though an option for realistic light falloff existed) and of course idealized materials that had lots of dials for creative control without any regards to physically accuracy or energy conservation. One could easily create a surface that was brighter then any of the lights hitting it for example.</p>
<p>With that creative freedom comes a lot of complexity though to get something that can be considered &ldquo;correct&rdquo; when it comes to realism, a required goalpost when you want to integrate your renderings into filmed footage.</p>
<p>To get to an acceptable result quicker and with less complications, Pixar started to implement physically plausible rendering which was first used in Iron Man and later in Monster University to great effect. This proved that both realistic and stylized results were possible with this physically more accurate model despite it having less dials.</p>
<p>While RSL 2.0 was quite successful it still had a few problems. Mainly it slowed down in complex raytracing setups due to Ray Hit Shading taking a lot of time and the memory usage exploded with complex scenes. This lead Pixar to develop a path tracing approach and a new render engine called RIS. For an in depth overview see last year&rsquo;s article on <a href="http://www.fxguide.com/featured/rendermanris-and-the-start-of-next-25-years/">RIS</a>.</p>
<p>RIS allows for even simpler controls, while rendering more accurately, faster and with less memory then the RSL approach. Shaders are now fully integrated but very modular, which allows for easy debugging or switching out whole block for quickly getting different results.</p>
<p><em>Finding Dory</em>, which is currently in production at Pixar, is the first movie that is using RIS. In fact, Dory is the first use of what Christophe calls the RUKUS pipeline: RIS, <a href="http://graphics.pixar.com/usd/">USD</a> a new interchange format developed at Pixar similar to Alembic and Katana. Christophe joked that he still hasn&rsquo;t figured out what U and S stand for.</p>
<p>Since RIS has the ability to do progressive rendering, the look development and final rendering has accelerated quite a bit. An artist can set up a complex shot, put it on the farm and then &ldquo;check in&rdquo; after say 20 minutes and get a good idea what the final images are going to look like as the whole image is already visible, albeit very noisy. Then they can just let it &ldquo;cook&rdquo; on the farm until an acceptable noise level is reached. The remaining noise residue is being filtered away as a last step. A technology that Pixar was able to use from Hyperion, Disney&rsquo;s new Path Tracing engine and it will be part of the public Renderman release in the future.</p>
<p>This means there is less human (expensive) time needed to set up a shot as there is much less trial and error. Artist always have a really good idea of what the final result is going to look like.</p>
<p>Sadly, Christophe wasn&rsquo;t able to show us final imagery of Dory, as production isn&rsquo;t that far along yet, but we did see a few shots of Dory and Nemo in their new look and they do look much improved from their old selves. We saw them being shaded, lit and look dev&rsquo;ed in realtime in Katana and the experience looked very smooth and seamless.</p>

		<a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2015/05/06/hyperion-brent-burley.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2015-05-06 11:29:11 &#43;0200">May 6, 2015</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Brent Burley talked us through the development of Disney&rsquo;s new Path Tracer <em>Hyperion</em> in this session. Path Tracing is the third cornerstone in Disney&rsquo;s new rendering strategy with the former two being <a href="http://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/publications/26#">PTex</a> and the new <a href="https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/library/s2012_pbs_disney_brdf_slides_v2.pdf">&ldquo;principled&rdquo; BRDF</a> (Disney made available a nice tool to explore different measured BRDFs called <a href="http://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/brdf.html">BRDF Explorer</a>).</p>
<p>Hyperion was used as the main renderer for Big Hero 6, Disney&rsquo;s newest animated feature film. This was a big challenge as the development of Hyperion started only about three or four months before movie production. In essence the development of the movie and the render engine were in sync. This was a bit of a gamble, because the engine didn&rsquo;t have all of its features yet and there was no way of telling how development would turn out down the road.</p>
<p>Like Manuka, Weta&rsquo;s new render engine, or Arnold, Hyperion is a Path Tracer. The biggest problem with path tracers is the inherent noise. So where you get the benefit of a &ldquo;correct&rdquo; solution and relatively few dials for the artist to &ldquo;fight&rdquo; with, the downside is that it is very hard to get rid of the noise in a timely manner.</p>
<p>This is an inherently mathematical problem to deal with. To half the noise in an image, you have to quadruple the samples fired into the scene. Since you are always halving the noise, there is never a stage where you can reach zero noise. The best you can hope for is to reach a certain noise floor. Meaning all the important details in the image are represented (instead of hidden in too much noise). Once you reach that noise floor, the best solution Disney has found is to filter out the remaining noise.</p>
<p>To converge to the noise floor as quickly as possible, there are a few optimization techniques at work. First, rays in areas of common interest are grouped into batches. Those batches receive a high number of samples that are then smartly &ldquo;redistributed&rdquo; to the corresponding pixels. At technique I haven&rsquo;t yet completely grasped, but that I plan to revisit with Mr Burley when I get a chance.</p>
<p>The net win seems to be with multiple bounces. First the speed hit is very minimal with multiple bounces and you need less bounces overall to reach acceptable light energy in the scene.</p>
<p>This was tested by going into a lighting lab situation. In essence they took a series of photographs and replicated the results with Hyperion. The results where pretty exact and it turns out that images that <em>seemed</em> to deliver wrong results where simply not using enough bounces. Once the proper bounce amount was dialed in, all the glows, light bleeds and so forth started working and the results looked natural.</p>
<p>Another optimization technique was the <em>Statistical Lobe Selection Tree</em>, which basically applies weights to the components of a pixel (light influence, reflective, diffuse, refractive influence, etc.). Once you have figured out what influences the pixel most, you can spend more samples there.</p>
<p>This got turned on its head when artists started using tens of thousands of lights in a shot. Sorting that many lights would have taken longer then simply brute forcing the sampling. The solution was to figure out where 95% of the influence comes from, which is usually the five or so closest lights, and then use the other 5% for a randomly picked light source.</p>
<p>There are also effects that can take a long time to calculate with even just one sample. Like a ray that bounces around skin for a while, just to exit somewhere else with less energy. in those cases Disney used a simple &ldquo;shortcut&rdquo;: <em>biased filtering</em>.</p>
<p>Say for Subsurface Scattering, Disney simply assumes that a ray exits a random maximum distance from the entry point with a certain amount of less energy. Which works well for most situations for things like SSS or hair. It has issues with small objects, but those can be worked around.
The next step in Hyperion development is actually to improve the workflow for those situations in the future.</p>
<p>Another common issue were fireflies on water from bright light sources. Sun, anyone? This also is an intrinsically mathematical issue as the sun is a tiny and incredibly bright light source, which means it&rsquo;s practically impossible to converge to a noise free result. The workaround they came up with was pretty genius. They first create a photon map that stores the energy of the refracted and reflected light and then use the calculated light energy values to basically turn hard surface objects into emitters. That means they spread out the high energy light source of the sun and made it trivial to sample. The result were beautiful caustics and inter reflections without any noise or sparkling at a reasonable rendertime.</p>
<p>A tricky thing with path tracers is the output of different passes for compositing. For this, Hyperion uses a technique called <em>Stochastic Path Classification</em>, which allows inexpensive splitting of a light ray into diffuse and specular components (and a number of additional passes). An added benefit is that it becomes possible to add some artistic local control on top of a shader. They call it <em>transport modifier</em> and it allows artists to tell a surface to use less specular contribution for example.</p>
<p>One interesting statistic was that due to the progressive nature of a path tracer only 15% re-renders took place. Meaning that most of the shots only had one final render pass. This was possible because every artist in every department always has a noisy preview of the final image in, more or less, realtime. There were no unexpected surprises, which made it possible to render the whole show in less then four months.</p>

			 <p>I recently took stock of my video tutorial archive and it turns out I have 4,5 months of <a href="http://www.fxphd.com">fxphd</a> videos alone (assuming I watch them eight hours a day and take weekend breaks). Add to that  tons of modo tutorials, Maya, Gnomon, Lynda.com, Digital Tutors, you name it. That is a <strong>lot</strong> of accumulated knowledge. It also was a large enough number that I started to ask myself if I really need this many tutorials or if I am just addicted to collecting as many as possible. I am behind on watching them after all.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about the old saying that one should surround oneself with people more skilled then oneself or smarter or generally just better‚Äîdepending on the source of the quote.</p>
<p>I work from home, so while I see the wisdom in these words, actually doing something about it tends to be tricky when you are stuck in your own four walls almost 24/7. But it occurred to me that I <em>am</em> surrounding myself with smarter, more skilled people all the time. They mostly come too me in the form of video tutorials. I get to see a ton of different people showing me their way of tackling problems and offering solutions I would have never thought of. And, true, open time spots to watch them fluctuate wildly depending on project load, but I am also known for watching tutorials for a whole week straight if business is running a bit slow.</p>
<p>I feel like this is a very valuable practice that allows me to not only keep my sanity sitting mostly alone in an office, but also fill my subconsious with tons of input that I am able to make use of at a later date.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My workday consists, like pretty much everyone else‚Äôs these days, of about 99% sitting in front of a computer followed by more sitting on the couch after work. I recently jumped on the <a href="http://ddg.gg/?q=standing+desk">bandwagon</a> and decided to stand more often.</p>
<p>Overall I am trying to stand in the morning and sit in the afternoon, which works out fine most days. Occasionally I‚Äôll switch it around, but standing in the morning has the effect of keeping morning drowsiness at bay.</p>
<p>I can confirm that concentrating while standing is a bit harder at first, but on the flip side I find that I am much more focused once I managed to find my focus.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm lucky as my desk is already height adjustable. Only by about 10 centimeters or so, but in combination with my height adjustable monitor on a little pedestal it is enough to accommodate a sitting and a standing configuration.</p>
<p>I also built myself a little table for my keyboard, mouse and a glass of water out of a very nice bamboo slab. I‚Äôm kind of proud of it. It feels very smooth and doing the little bit of carpentry was refreshing.</p>
<p>Having something I built myself also seems to help with daily motivation to actually stand. I had a crude setup before the bamboo table was finished and I noticed that I skipped standing much more often.</p>
<p>Cost for this little endeavor was about ‚Ç¨50, but only because I splurged a bit for a nice wooden slab and some high quality varnish.</p>
<p>After a few weeks I feel good about this setup and am already thinking about upgrading it from a standing to a walking desk. The costs for a good treadmill that will fit under a desk are considerable though. From my research I gathered that one will come in at around ‚Ç¨1000 no matter which brand. This will need some more pondering, but in the end it is probably worth it to get more active.</p>

			 <p>You. Yes, you, the one person that has visited this site in the last year. You will likely not have noticed, but this site is once again looking 100% different again.</p>
<p>I got bit by the CSS bug again a couple of weeks ago, got myself <a href="http://www.abookapart.com" title="A Book Apart">some new books on web design and content strategy</a> and a new <a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com" title="Ulysses III">writing app</a> and here we are.</p>
<p>The new look is the barest minimum of chrome. I want you to focus on the words on this site. I might not be a great writer or even a good one, but I do appreciate a clean design and the power of words. That‚Äôs why I come back to this blog time and time again, even after I have seemingly abandoned it.</p>
<p>This time around I am not only trying post more often (like that worked so well before), but also to link to stuff I find interesting without much ado. That will hopefully to get me to spend more time with the site and motivate me to write longer articles again.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the spirit of app recommendation lists that keep popping up everywhere I decided to make my own. I do have a lot of iOS apps. In fact, I went a little overboard in 2012 and the first half of 2013. So much so that after I added up the amount of money I spent on app purchases, I went on a very strict app feast for the rest of 2013.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point is that I have tried a lot of apps and a couple stuck leading to the top apps I use today. Each category is in order of importance to my way of working. Well more or less. Halfway through I wasn&rsquo;t able to decide on the proper order, so higher up is generally more important to me, but it&rsquo;s a sliding scale the further down you get.</p>

<li><a href="#media">Media</a></li>
<li><a href="#shopping">Shopping</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="internet">Internet Apps</h2>
<p>While Internet is a pretty broad term, I use it to designate apps that are used to interact with the online world.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/felix-iphone-edition/id562447652?mt=8">Felix</a>
Without doubt still my favorite <a href="http://app.net">App.net</a> client. It has gotten pretty slow on my iPhone 4, but I still keep coming back to it every day. Felix definitely is a top contender to the &ldquo;most used app&rdquo; spot.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunstroke/id488564806?mt=8">Sunstroke</a>
For my news reading I am using a <a href="http://feedafever.com/">Fever</a> install on my server. Sunstroke is without a doubt the best way to access my Fever feeds on the iPhone and I have tried pretty much every Fever compatible iPhone client out there. It is not as versatile as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8">Mr. Reader</a> on the iPad for sharing out items, but from a pure reading perspective I have yet to find a better app.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-5-for-twitter/id580311103?mt=8">Twitteriffic</a></p>
<p>I hardly use <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> anymore these days. <a href="http://app.net">App.net</a> has almost completely replaced the service with the bird for me. However, a lot of my colleagues still use it and I need a way to occasionally respond to DMs and mentions. Twitteriffic is a beautiful and more then adequate Twitter client for this job.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articles/id364881979?mt=8">Articles</a></p>
<p>For my <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> research I prefer to use a dedicated client like Articles. This is one area where I grabbed the client that looked best for me way back when I got my first iPhone and I just never tried another one. So there might be better Wikipedia clients out there, but Articles suits me just fine.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dict.cc-dictionary/id327732352?mt=8">dict.cc</a></p>
<p>While my English is reasonably good, I do need to look up words once in a while. I found dict.cc a pretty good dictionary. Plus it is an offline dictionary, which is still something I rely on occasionally in spots with bad reception.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weatherpro/id294631159?mt=8">WeatherPro</a></p>
<p>I usually check the weather by looking out the window‚Äînow there&rsquo;s a revolutionary idea! But when I need to look up the weather at a travel destination or to check a forecast for the upcoming week WeatherPro has proven to be the most reliable app for Germany and Europe in general. And it has nice detailed statistical infos and weather radar imagery. Not that I could make heads or tails of those, but they look nice.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outbank/id585564091?mt=8">Outbank</a></p>
<p>For German bank accounts there is nothing better then Outbank. It is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and it actually works with a wide array of banks. While I don&rsquo;t check my accounts daily, Outbank is certainly the cornerstone of my own digital accounting and that of our business.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screens-vnc-access-your-computer/id655890150?mt=8">Screens VNC</a></p>
<p>Another one of these &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use often, but critical when I do&rdquo; apps. Screens allows me to quickly fix things on our server even when I am hundreds of kilometers away from home. Together with Screens Connect, its desktop counterpart, setup is a breeze and I don&rsquo;t have to trouble myself with ports and SSL, etc. It just works.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pushpin-for-pinboard/id548052590?mt=8">Pushpin</a></p>
<p>I use <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> for everything bookmarking related, including keeping a downloadable archive of the bookmark, meaning if the page you bookmarked goes offline, you&rsquo;ll still be able to see the archived copy indefinitely.</p>
<p>And a big feature for me is that I use Pinboard as Instapaper replacement. Pushpin is the client that helps me achieve that last part. Right now it is a basic way to browse my bookmarks and catch up on my unread items. However, there is a feature in the works that will make my goal of using Pinboard and Instapaper replacement complete: Offline reading. I don&rsquo;t know when exactly it is coming, but I was assured it is coming and when the day comes it will be glorious. Or so I hope‚Ä¶</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8">Dropbox</a>{#dropbox}</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use the app that often, but it is very comforting to know that I have the option. Getting at anything in my Dropbox within a matter of seconds is truly convenient.</p>
<p>###<a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/facetime/">FaceTime</a></p>
<p>Skype can suck it. Especially since Microsoft took over and ruined the app even more. &lsquo;Nuff said.</p>
<p>##Productivity {#productiviy}</p>
<p>Productivity is such a loaded word that I try to avoid it. In this case I really am referring to apps that allow me to do work or to keep track of stuff.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8">1Password</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to survive without 1Password. I&rsquo;d have to use the same password everywhere or juggle paper lists or something. Madness would ensue pretty quickly I am sure.</p>
<p>Thankfully, AgileBits has me covered in the insanity department. 1Password is the first app I install on any machine. And since it syncs via Dropbox I can access my password library <a href="http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/1passwordanywhere.html">even when I am on a random computer with Internet access</a>.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/begin-your-daily-to-do-list/id687455038?mt=8">Begin</a></p>
<p>Great little to do list app. Simple and very bare bones. Just what I need. I also have Omnifocus, but rarely use it. Begin I actually do use. It is a refreshing take on the old paradigm of creating lists to check off.</p>
<p>###Mail.app</p>
<p>What can I say? I rely on email and I find the default mail app to be very much sufficient. I have used Sparrow in the past, but with iOS 7 I switched back to the default app and haven&rsquo;t looked back.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8">Drafts</a></p>
<p>While I prefer to write on my iPad, I do use Drafts on the iPhone to sketch out quick ideas or as simple pasteboard. Sync with the Drafts for iPad app is instantaneous, so I can start a thought on my iPhone and continue it on my iPad in Drafts or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8">Editorial</a> without effort.</p>
<p>I have set up a nice little array of custom actions in Drafts, which allows me to use it as a plain text journaling app or as a quick entry bucket for story ideas.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calendars-5-smart-calendar/id697927927?mt=8">Calendars 5</a></p>
<p>I used <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/fantastical-2/id718043190?mt=8">Fantastical</a> before Calendars, but as it turns out Calendars has the same natural language event creation, but a much nicer calendar interface. I don&rsquo;t use a calendar that often really, but it is always a pleasure to use Calendars 5 when I have to.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite-best-free-calculator/id300311831?mt=8">PCcalc</a></p>
<p>Powerful, quick, to the point. When I need to use a calculator this is the one I turn to. It allows me to be as simple or as complex in my calculations as I need to be and it can do so much more like convert units. Though for unit conversion I tend to use <a href="#vert">Vert</a>.</p>
<p>I linked to the free version above as that is already plenty powerful and if you so desire you can upgrade its functionality to suit your needs, which is exactly what I have done.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vert-2-unit-currency-converter/id691346630?mt=8">Vert</a>{#vert}</p>
<p>Vert is another one of those laser focused apps without any cruft, a concept that I seem to really gravitate to, don&rsquo;t I? Vert does exactly what it says on the tin. It converts a wide array of units and does so in a fast and efficient manner.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outliner/id284455726?mt=8">CarbonFin Outliner</a></p>
<p>Sometimes I need a list that is neither a todo list nor a full outline or mindmap. CarbonFin Outliner fills that niche nicely. It is very much alike the famous <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner">OmniOutliner</a> condensed down for iPhone. It can be used as todo list app or as full blown outliner with comments and the likes. But it is clean enough that I can use it for my simple list making.</p>
<p>###<a href="http://www.navigon.com/portal/us/produkte/navigationssoftware/mobile_navigator_iphone_us.html">Navigon</a></p>
<p>The only turn by turn navigation I use. It is accurate, regularly updated with up to date map data and is generally nice to use.</p>
<p>From the looks of it my global version of Navigon isn&rsquo;t offered any longer on the App Store. Instead there are several region based apps at a cheaper price.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/db-navigator/id343555245?mt=8">DB Navigator</a></p>
<p>The app of the German railway services. More of a nuisance then a must have, but it is better then juggling paper tickets.</p>
<p>##Media {#media}</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-high-fidelity-podcasts/id723142770?mt=8">Castro</a>
The new kid on the podcast client block has bedazzled me from the day it came out. Yes, it is very minimal in its feature set. However, I found that it actually offers all the features I need and not more. Before I was using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/instacast-3/id577056377?mt=8">Instacast</a> and lately <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8">Downcast</a>, both great apps, but much too fiddly.</p>
<p>I am so much happier with Castro and without feature bloat. Give it a try. You might like it.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audiobooks-from-audible/id379693831?mt=8">Audible</a></p>
<p>I cannot say enough good things about Audible. I love the way their service works. I love audiobooks. I love this app. That plus the fact that the support is simply awesome. Recently I found out that you can return two books a year within a year of purchase for a full refund without challenge from the staff. How awesome is that?</p>
<p>I highly recommend a membership with them.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/naturespace-relax-meditate/id312618509?mt=8">Naturespace</a></p>
<p>Sometimes I need to switch off my brain completely or shut out the world. Naturespace is brilliant for that. It offers a great collection of high quality nature sounds that really transport you to the recorded location when you close your eyes.</p>
<p>Listening to nature is a poor mans replacement to actually going outside, but it is worlds better then blasting my ears with music all day or using white noise to drown out environmental distractions.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera+/id329670577?mt=8">Camera+</a></p>
<p>My preferred quick and dirty image editor on the go. It has some nice filters and allows for some quick edits. And it allows me to share my pictures quickly and painlessly.</p>
<p>There are other similar image editors like VSCO Cam (which I won&rsquo;t link to, because I despise it), but they all are too slow, ugly or have horrible filters in my opinion.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filterstorm-neue/id728479183?mt=8">Filterstorm Neue</a></p>
<p>Now this is a real work horse. Where Camera+ is my <em>Instagram</em> app, Filterstorm is my image editor on the go. It is pretty amazing what the developer has managed to pull of here. Quick, high quality editing on a tiny screen and excellent sharing options including direct FTP upload.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autostitch-panorama/id318944927?mt=8">AutoStitch</a></p>
<p>I do love panoramas. While the iOS panorama feature looks neat, my iPhone 4 is unable to use it. Also, I usually need more then a single horizontal strip of photos for my panoramas.</p>
<p>AutoStitch is the best panorama app I have found. I can throw any amount of images at it snapped in all kinds of angles and it stitches them into a coherent panorama at a great quality and at up to 18 megapixels if I so desire.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camerasync/id406645727?mt=8">CameraSync</a></p>
<p>Once my images have been taken and edited, I upload them to <a href="#dropbox">Dropbox</a>, my main storage location for all my pictures. CameraSync does so automatically in the background with a good selection of powerful options including the ability to prevent screenshots and videos from being uploaded if one so wishes.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unbound-for-dropbox/id586086921?mt=8">Unbound</a></p>
<p>After my images have uploaded with CameraSync I tend to delete them from my device. Unbound allows me to browse my complete image library from <a href="#dropbox">Dropbox</a> in a nice interface.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-for/id406732590?mt=8">Paprika</a></p>
<p>A cooking app isn&rsquo;t exactly media, but it is the only category that semi-fit. Paprika is a great recipe app, because it is available on iPhone, iPad and OS X and the recipes are synced between the devices. I can type in a new recipe when I am away for work and my wife can cook the dish at home a minute later or vice versa. Perfect.</p>
<p>##Shopping {#shopping}</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-app/id297606951?mt=8">Amazon</a></p>
<p>I get <strong>everything</strong> from Amazon. The app is at the same time convenient and really not great to use. But it is better then the website at least from the iPhone, so I&rsquo;m using it.</p>
<p>###<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kickstarter-for-iphone/id596961532?mt=8">Kickstarter</a></p>
<p>Hi. My name is Alex and I have a Kickstarter addiction.</p>
<p>Seriously though, I love browsing <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> projects in the app for awesome projects, while at the same time hoping that there won&rsquo;t be, so I don&rsquo;t feel compelled to throw money out the window.</p>
<p>I really should delete this app‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The best way to track where my shipments are at. Fullstop. Again a service that syncs across iOS and OS X. Those are really the most versatile, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Pew, that was quite the list. While I don&rsquo;t use everything on this list daily and these are by far not the only apps I have installed on my iPhone, I would consider this group of apps essential for my daily work and play. I hope there were some nuggets in there for you <a href="https://alpha.app.net/hashtags/teamappdiction">#teamappdiction</a> people. :)</p>

			 <p>Inspired by <a href="http://app.net/viticci">Federico Viticci&rsquo;s</a> <em>Open Tabs</em> <a href="http://editorial-app.com/">Editorial</a> workflow, I created this little workflow to quickly capture and act on story ideas for blog posts or other text documents.</p>
<p>It all starts in <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts">Drafts</a>, which I can fire up wherever I go from my iPhone. I enter an idea, or a short title or a link with a comment. This then gets appended to a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> file on Dropbox called <em>Story Ideas.md</em>. Conveniently, this file lives in my Editorial folder in Dropbox and show right up on my iPad.</p>
<p>So this:</p>
<pre><code>Write about this cool workflow
</code></pre>
<p>Becomes this in my <em>Story Ideas.md</em>:</p>
<pre><code>2013-12-06 - Write about this cool workflow

---
</code></pre>
<p>In Editorial, I have a workflow called <em>Manage Story Ideas</em> that allows me to extract an idea from the whole document into a new document ready for editing. Alternatively, I can also delete the idea if I decide it&rsquo;s not worth pursuing after all.</p>
<p>I wanted the workflow to open up the newly created document ready for editing. Sadly, Editorial currently has a bug that doesn&rsquo;t all that, so that little extra convenience has to wait until the next Editorial update.</p>
<p>You can get the Drafts action by clicking <a href="drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=dropbox&amp;name=Story%20Ideas&amp;path=%2FApps%2FEditorial%2F&amp;filenametype=2&amp;filename=Story%20Ideas&amp;ext=md&amp;writetype=2&amp;template=%0A%5B%5Bdate%5D%5D%20-%20%5B%5Bdraft%5D%5D%0A%0A---%0A">here</a> and the Editorial workflow is available on the <a href="http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5829156457676800/tOuSi63Z-Ik">Workflow Sharing site</a>.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m reading <a href="http://app.net/shawnblanc">Shawn Blanc&rsquo;s</a> wonderful book <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/thedetails/">Delight is in the Details</a> and this one chapter rings especially true with me. It&rsquo;s about what I like to call <em>the creative cringe</em>, the feeling everyone of us gets when we see our work and are not satisfied with it or where we see all the little and not so little flaws that make us cringe.</p>
<p>Shawn is quoting <a href="http://youtu.be/PbC4gqZGPSY">Ira Glass</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄûAll of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it‚Äôs just not that good. It‚Äôs trying to be good, it has potential, but it‚Äôs not. But your taste ‚Äî the thing that got you into the game ‚Äî is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn‚Äôt have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it‚Äôs normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone[‚Ä¶]‚Äú</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much afflicted by this phenomenon. Not that my work is anything special, but I get the cringing  feeling almost every time, especially on client projects, where budgets usually are the restricting factor and not the‚Äîmythical‚Äî <em>perfect</em> end result.</p>
<p>But it is important to not let yourself get dragged down and to see this feeling as a sign that there is still some great work hidden inside yourself and that you need to keep working on your skills so you can eventually bring it forth.</p>
<p>Or as Shawn puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄûIf, one day, we feel as if we‚Äôve reached a point where we can create work that will never make us cringe again, then what we‚Äôre saying is that what we do today will be just as good as what we do next month, next year, and 10 years from now. And, well, that‚Äôs just not fair to our future selves.‚Äú</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now go and do yourself a favor and get reading <a href="http://app.net/shawnblanc">Shawn&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/thedetails/">book</a> as long as it is still 25% off.</p>

<p>Yes, I finally am blogging again. Only 6 months of silence this time. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>Anyway, a major hindrance was that my blogging workflow wasn&rsquo;t working quite right yet, which in turn was like an invisible wall that I was just too tired to climb each time I want to post something. Luckily, I have had the last two days to tinker with it and to figure it out. Now I have a pretty solid workflow. Well, at the moment it looks solid. It is not battle tested however. That&rsquo;s what future blog posts are for.</p>
<p>But since it is a little involved, I thought I&rsquo;d write it down here right away. For one so I won&rsquo;t forget and also some friends asked me how I am handling blogging from iOS to my <a href="http://getkirby.com">Kirby</a> blog.</p>
<h2 id="tldr1">Tl;dr<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>Write your post in whatever text editor you prefer. Ideally one that supports x-callbacks. I personally use Editorial since it&rsquo;s nice for writing and I also use it for processing everything anyway. Before that I used Drafts together with Editorial.</p>
<p>Fire off the Editorial workflow that transforms your text into a blog post with the correct formatting and uploads it to Dropbox.</p>
<p>Create or edit any imagery that goes along with the post and upload the images to the right Dropbox folder. The path of said folder has been copied to the clipboard by the above Editorial workflow.</p>
<p>Have Hazel put everything into place and let it upload to post to the web server.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-version">The long version</h2>
<p>There are several steps involved to make this work. It sounds complicated, but is actually rather straightforward.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://getkirby.com">Kirby</a>, of course.</li>
<li><a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> (or any other editor that allows you to send stuff to Editorial via <a href="http://x-callback-url.com/">x-callback URLs</a>).</li>
<li><a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a>, <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/index.html">Pythonista</a> works equally well, but Editorial is simpler to set up, plus you can write in Editorial as well and just skip <em>Drafts</em> entirely, which is what I do most of the time.</li>
<li><a href="http://filterstormneue.com">Filterstorm Neue</a> or alternatively Photoforge 2 if you still have access to it.</li>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li><a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com">Hazel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.crushftp.com">CrushFTP</a>, optional, but depending on the image editor you use more convenient</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kirby">Kirby</h3>
<p>First of all, why Kirby? Sounds like an awful lot of work for something that Tumblr offers for free. Tumblr even has an iOS app. Just log in and be done with it.</p>
<p>For me it comes down to owning what I create. And that involves hosting  what I create. Yes, Kirby is a little more involved and‚Äî <em>gasp</em> ‚Äîcosts money, but it is really flexible‚ÄîI built several sites with it for myself, friends and even customers‚Äî, fast and pretty cheap considering.</p>
<p>Plus it works with text files and Markdown, both things that I value dearly and that make this specific workflow possible without a special &ldquo;<em>Kirby iOS app</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="drafts-optional">Drafts (optional)</h3>
<p><em>For completeness sake I&rsquo;m including my Drafts workflow as well. However, I have since completely switched over to Editorial for writing as well as post-processing my posts.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I started writing my posts in Agile Tortoise&rsquo;s Drafts, a fine and frictionless text editor with the added bonus that it supports the x-callback URL scheme and a ton of other ways to share or manipulate the written word.</p>
<p>When I write a blog entry, I put the post&rsquo;s title in the first line and the actual post content right after it. If I want a subtitle, that goes at the very bottom with the tag <code>Subtitle:</code></p>
<p>So a typical post in Drafts would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>This is my title

And this is my content.
It can have any content. Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it.

----

Subtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle.
</code></pre>
<p>When it comes time to share my post with the world, I have a Dropbox action called <em>Blog Post</em>, that will create a file in a designated Dropbox folder‚ÄîI have a global <em>Apps</em> folder and I put it in a subfolder there‚Äîwith the name of my post title as filename. It will also fill in a couple of things for me. Most notably the date and the title. So the above post transforms into:</p>
<p>&lsquo;<code>This is my title.md</code>&rsquo; with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>Title: This is my title

----

Date: 07.11.13 (used for display purposes)

----

Time: 2013-11-07-17-33-55 (used for sorting purposes)

----

And this is my content.
It can have any content. Paragraphs, code blocks, lists, you name it.

----

Subtitle: And then at the bottom I have the option to put a subtitle.
</code></pre>
<p>You can import this action into Drafts by clicking this link: <a href="drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=dropbox&amp;name=Blog%20Post&amp;path=%2FApps%2FDrafts%2FKirby%2FBlog%2F&amp;filenametype=1&amp;filename=&amp;ext=md&amp;writetype=0&amp;template=Title%3A%20%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0ADate%3A%20%5B%5Bdate%7C%25d.%25m.%25Y%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0ATime%3A%20%5B%5Btime%5D%5D%0A%0A----%0A%0AText%3A%20%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D">‚Üí Import Blog Posts action into Drafts</a></p>
<h3 id="editorial">Editorial</h3>
<p><em>This first part is part of the old Drafts workflow. Jump to the second part to see how I&rsquo;m working right now.</em></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="the-old-way">The <em>old</em> way</h4>
<p>The next two steps are only for the times I want or need images in my posts or if I want to create one of those snazzy banners that are sorely underrepresented in my blog.</p>
<p>I use Editorial as a simple text filter in this case. I could write something like this for Pythonista to make it work on iPhone (Editorial is iPad only), but I, well, I didn&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>
<p>Editorial simply gives me back the future path of my new blog post, something I need if I want to drop pictures into that folder without hunting for the correct folder in my next step.</p>
<p>I send over my post from Drafts to Editorial with a simple x-callback URL.</p>
<p>You can import the URL Action into Drafts by clicking this link: <a href="drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=URL&amp;name=Copy%20Blog%20Path&amp;url=editorial%3A%2F%2F%3Fcommand%3D%7B%7Bcreate%20blog%20URL%7D%7D%26input%3D%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D">‚Üí Import URL action &ldquo;Copy Blog Path&rdquo; into Drafts</a></p>
<p>Editorial then cleans it up in a variety of ways. For example, everything gets turned to lowercase, spaces are removed, etc.</p>
<p>The resulting URL is copied to the clipboard. In the example above <code>This is my title</code> turns into <code>http://alexanderkucera.com/20131108-this_is_my_title</code>.</p>
<p>I opted not to run any action after this, as I want to be able to switch to any app I want as the situation requires. But usually it is now on to <em>Filterstorm</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to import the URL cleanup workflow into Editorial or simply read through it in detail, you can take a look at this <a href="http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5035202761981952/hTzXZVeWcLI">&ldquo;create blog URL&rdquo; Editorial Action</a></p>
<h4 id="the-new-way">The <em>new</em> way</h4>
<p>Since I have completely switched over from Drafts to Editorial, I had to create a workflow that would prep a standard Markdown document and turn it into a blog post. Since Editorial is much more powerful then Drafts, I was also able to make it a bit smarter, ask for input on a few things and optionally archive or delete a post once I&rsquo;m done with it.</p>
<p>It does a lot of things similar to my Drafts workflow though. After all is said and done, a file with the correct naming scheme gets written to a Dropbox folder. And I also get the blog URL at the end from the workflow above.</p>
<p>The bonus with the Editorial workflow is that I don&rsquo;t need to watch out for any specific formatting. I can have a standard Markdown document and everything <em>just works‚Ñ¢</em>. And Editorial is just really pleasant to work in.</p>
<p><a href="http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5895905618165760/iEqPb0_XVkw">Editorial Blog Posting Workflow</a></p>
<h3 id="filterstorm-neue">Filterstorm (Neue)</h3>
<p>Filterstorm Neue, is brand new, but the old Filterstorm or Filterstorm Pro have pretty much the same abilities. Or you could use Photoforge 2 if you still have it. The important bit is that the app allows you to either <strong>export to Dropbox or to upload via FTP</strong> and to give your images <strong>a name of your choosing</strong>.</p>
<p>Well, this step is really simple. Do your image edits. Done? Ok. Then upload it to the folder we just had the path created for in Editorial. Simple, right?</p>
<p>Well, yes and no. There is one step that I consider crucial. I don&rsquo;t want to upload to my web server. I want to upload my image to Dropbox. I consider the Dropbox version of my site to be the canonical copy. Everything goes there first and then gets uploaded to the server. Otherwise I end up with a file mess. Files might get updated or changed here or there. Who knows? By always going Dropbox first, that issue gets sidestepped completely.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have an <em>always on</em> server machine, your best bet is to find a way to upload to Dropbox directly. Photoforge has a Dropbox uploading feature. Filterstorm does as well, though it involves browsing to your posts folder manually instead of just giving it a path.</p>
<p>For various reasons, mostly because I don&rsquo;t want to hunt down a folder and I have the exact path I need from my Editorial workflow above, I decided to go a completely different route: FTP.</p>
<p>I happen to use CrushFTP for work anyway, which means I just need to set up an FTP account that points to the blog&rsquo;s content folder in my server&rsquo;s Dropbox folder and the rest is very straightforward. Get path from Editorial and upload to said path.</p>
<h3 id="hazel">Hazel</h3>
<p>The last and final step. The one step that unifies desktop and iOS blogging. Automatically uploading my posts from Dropbox to the server. Hazel is the perfect match for that. Especially since it got the ability to open an FTP connection on its own a couple of versions back.</p>
<p>The Hazel flow goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look into the Drafts Or Editorial app folder and check if there is new post.</li>
<li>Put the file into a subfolder called <code>&lt;date&gt;-postname</code>.</li>
<li>Rename the file to <code>article.md</code> (the name of my Kirby layout template for a blog post)</li>
<li>move the new folder with the post in it into my blog</li>
</ul>
<p>There another Hazel rule takes over as Hazel rules only ever can work on one folder at a time. It goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a folder? Look into it.</li>
<li>Any file that doesn&rsquo;t have a red or grey color tag and that has been modified within the day gets uploaded</li>
<li>After the upload color the file grey</li>
</ul>
<p>The color tags are there to stop Hazel from constantly uploading files that have been modified inside the &ldquo;today&rdquo; timeframe. But they also allow me to simply take off the color label if I want a file to be re-uploaded.</p>
<p>Grab the Hazel ruleset here: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hazelrules.zip<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The one called <code>Drafts-Editorial-Folder</code> is for the incoming Drafts or Editorial file and the one called <code>Kirby-Blog-Folder</code> monitors the Kirby blog folder.</p>
<h2 id="thats-it">That&rsquo;s it.</h2>
<p>See? Simple, right?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have my own camera kit specifically for VFX yet. Usually when I am on set, I either rent or get equipment from the production that is hiring me. Now I am about to build my own camera kit and to stay halfway reasonable I want to stay around ‚Ç¨6000, though I can go over that amount to get a better kit if need be. And it looks like I might have to.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d ask you guys for opinions on what to get and if I maybe can switch around a few things to get the most bang for my buck. Also, writing it all down is more for my benefit really, as it allows me to think through things better.</p>
<p>The goal is to build a kit that works well in four different situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional:
<ul>
<li>Set photography (making reference photos, shooting textures, making set HDRis, etc.)</li>
<li>Panorama photography (HDRi and normal panoramas)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal:
<ul>
<li>Since I am a rather new dad (boy, 10 months) I will use the camera for child photography. He is already a speedy little guy and I only see this getting more intense as time moves on.</li>
<li>Also, we own three ferrets who are even speedier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So all things considered, I am looking to build a kit that serves well for kid and animal photography as well as on set photography.</p>
<h2 id="the-list">The List</h2>
<p>So far my list looks like this (all prices are not yet researched for cheapness but mostly straight off of Amazon):</p>
<h3 id="cameras">Cameras:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Canon 7D ~‚Ç¨1200</li>
<li>Canon 5D Mark III ~‚Ç¨2600</li>
<li>Canon 5D Mark II ~‚Ç¨2300</li>
</ul>
<p>I am itching for the full frame sensor. Getting the older MK2 doesn&rsquo;t seem to make much sense as it was still rather expensive when I looked.</p>
<p>The 7D I am unsure about. Yes, it is cheaper, but also not a full frame sensor. However, I could use the saved money to get more/better glass.</p>
<p>Another added benefit of the less then full frame sensor is that is allows me to capture a higher resolution panorama with the 8mm Sigma at the cost of needing one or two more shots to get a full 360¬∞ panorama. So higher res, but slower workflow.</p>
<h3 id="lenses">Lenses:</h3>
<p>The options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sigma 8mm Fisheye ~‚Ç¨750</li>
<li>Canon 50mm F1.2 (~‚Ç¨1400) or F1.4 (~‚Ç¨300)</li>
<li>Canon 70-200mm f2,8 ~‚Ç¨1000 (without image stabilization) or -2000 (with image stabilization)</li>
<li>Canon 70-200mm ~‚Ç¨1000 (or I go f4 with image stabilization)</li>
<li>Canon 20mm f2.8 ~‚Ç¨450</li>
<li>Canon EF 16-35mm 1:2,8L II USM ~‚Ç¨1300</li>
<li>Sigma 35 mm f/1,4 DG HSM ~‚Ç¨800</li>
<li>Canon EF 35mm 1:1,4 L USM ~‚Ç¨1300</li>
<li>Canon 24-70mm f2.8 ~‚Ç¨2000</li>
<li>Canon Extender EF 2x III ~‚Ç¨480</li>
</ul>
<p>I am only sure about the 8mm Sigma and pretty sure I want to get a 70-200mm, but inbetween I am torn. Get a 50mm prime or a 24-70mm zoom? Maybe a 35mm? 85mm?</p>
<p>I do like the added quality and speed of a prime lens. For my main use case, which will be professional panorama photography, I think I&rsquo;m going to go 8mm (standard, quick on-set pano HDR), 20mm (high-res on-set HDR pano) and 50mm (for those gigapanos and child photography).</p>
<p>The 70-200mm will be used for capturing textures and general on-set photography. Still not sure if I want the added quality of the f2.8 or if the f4 with image stabilization is good enough. It is a 1000 bucks difference after all.</p>
<h3 id="mounts-and-tripods">Mounts and Tripods:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nodal Ninja with RD16 ‚Ç¨449</li>
<li>Manfrotto 055CXPRO4 or 190CXPRO4 ~‚Ç¨200 (not sure, both cost about the same. I am open for other less pricey brands as well)</li>
<li>I already have a ball head</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup is pretty fixed. I like the Nodal Ninja and I have a ball head. I am open for a less expensive tripod, but given the quality of Manfrotto, ‚Ç¨200 isn&rsquo;t too bad, really.</p>
<h3 id="remotes">Remotes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Promote ~‚Ç¨380</li>
<li>Canon tc-80n3 ~‚Ç¨140</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m unsure about the MK3&rsquo;s bracketing as it only offers 1EV steps at maximum. The Promote would allow me to control that better, but it is double of the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; (and already rather pricey) Canon remote.</p>
<h3 id="all-the-other-stuff-one-needs-and-that-sucks-money-away">All the other stuff one needs and that sucks money away:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sandisk Compact Flash Extreme 32GB 60MB/s (I really don&rsquo;t see the point of going faster then 60 MB/s I&rsquo;m not planning to do much video with it) ~‚Ç¨75 a pop about three or four of these</li>
<li>Pelican card case ~‚Ç¨40</li>
<li>DELOCK Card Reader-FireWire ~‚Ç¨50</li>
<li>Hama Lenspen ~‚Ç¨12</li>
<li>Peli 1510 Carry On Case ~‚Ç¨300 or a nice huge backpack that can fit all of this gear. I&rsquo;m open for suggestions here.</li>
<li>a ruler of known length for matchmoving purposes</li>
<li>greyball 18% grey</li>
<li>Spyder Cube (was thinking of taking this instead of the grey ball as it is easier to get then 18% grey paint p lus it is very portable) ~‚Ç¨50</li>
<li>LightCraft Variable ND Fader ND MKII ~‚Ç¨100</li>
<li>B+W Cirkular Polarizer K√§semann F-Pro MRC DH 77mm ~‚Ç¨120</li>
<li>Leatherman Wave ~‚Ç¨70</li>
<li>X-Rite MSCCPP Passport ColorChecker ~‚Ç¨70</li>
<li>Leica D2 Laser measure ~‚Ç¨110</li>
<li>Bosch auto levelling laser cross ~‚Ç¨50</li>
<li>Canon battery packs LP-E6 ~‚Ç¨50</li>
<li>Suunto Pm-5 Clinometer ~‚Ç¨150</li>
<li>various self printed lens charts and tracking markers</li>
<li>tapes a whole bunch of them</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aperture (which I already have)</li>
<li>ptGUI (which I also already have)</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite the list, eh?</p>
<p>I think the stuff at the bottom is pretty much locked in (and already a hefty 1300 bucks price tag), but I am pretty uncertain how to balance the stuff at the top, especially lenses.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

And that without me purposefully disabling anything. So do yourself a favor and check those settings every now and then.

<p>I got access to my copy of <a href="http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun">Shadowrun Returns</a> right on release, July 25th, and immediately ended up playing it of about five hours. Probably your first clue that I liked it.</p>
<p>It has been described as Neverwinter Nights meets XCOM by its creators and that description is pretty accurate. I&rsquo;d add that it at times also has a little point and click adventure feel to it.</p>
<h2 id="on-a-budget">On A Budget</h2>
<p>Harebrained Software got $1.8 Million from Kickstarter, which, when you take away all the Kickstarter and Amazon fees plus physical rewards, ends up as about $1.2 Million for the actual game. It later racked up the budget with a loan and additional Pre-sales done via their website, so I&rsquo;m assuming that the actual budget ended up in the $2 Million range again. Which sounds like a lot, but it really isn&rsquo;t if you do the math.</p>
<p>Anyway, the developers did a remarkable job of translating the Shadowrun experience into a playable and infinitely expandable game. The environments are gorgeous, the first story that came with it is pretty solid and supposed to be about 12 hours of gameplay.</p>
<p>You can really only tell that they needed to cut stuff by the lack of detail in the characters. They just feel a little unpolished at times. The 3D characters that is. The character art is top notch.</p>
<p>Another thing that&rsquo;s sorely missing to give the game that extra bit of atmosphere is a voice over track. It&rsquo;s just a little lackluster to read all the dialogue. But I guess with the idea of an editor that allows you to expand the game ad infinitum, a VO track seems a little unrealistic.</p>
<p>But in the end, <a href="http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun">Shadowrun Returns</a> remains a great, atmospheric game and anyone even mildly into the Shadowrun universe owes himself to check it out.</p>

<p>Today,29.05.2013, was the official premiere of <strong>Prisoners of the Sun</strong>, the movie I was VFX producer for and that crashed and burned in 2008 due to a licensing issue. Luxx Studios bought the rights a while back and finished it. It turned out to be a modestly solid B-movie with 3D effects that looked very game-y, which is very sad, because we all‚Äîthe former production crew‚Äîknew what it could have been.</p>
<p>Sadly, not having the rights to the material tends to throw a wrench into finishing up a movie, or any project.</p>

			 <p>We startend the session with a quick history of subdivision surfaces. Invented by Pixar and first used in the short <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geri%27s_Game">Gerry&rsquo;s Game</a> they made away with the constraints of both polygonal modeling as well as Nurbs modeling.</p>
<h1 id="whats-wrong-with-nurbs">What&rsquo;s wrong with Nurbs?</h1>
<p>Nurbs surfaces are based on control vertices or hull points through which a b-spline is calculated. This leads to smooth curvature and inherent UVs. Both are good. However, Nurbs modeling relies on adding a multitude of Nurbs patches together to form you final surface. He problem arises at those patch seems where it can, and often is, mathematically impossible to create a seamless surface, much less when the &ldquo;patchwork&rdquo; is animated.</p>
<h1 id="so-polygons-then">So Polygons then?</h1>
<p>Short answer: nope.</p>
<p>Long answer: While polygons have no problem with arbitrarily complex surfaces or seem cracks, they have their own set of problems. First, they don&rsquo;t have inherent UVs and unwrapping a complex mesh for texturing is no small feat. Second, to get smooth surfaces you need a very high amount of polygons or play cheap tricks with normals, which tend to quickly fall apart under scrutiny.</p>
<h1 id="subdivs">Subdivs</h1>
<p>First, the world in general and Pixar in specific only calls then Subdivs. Not subdivision surfaces.</p>
<p>Also, they are the answer to all the problems above. Arbitrarily complex, while always maintaining a definably smooth, crack free surface. Also, with the addition of PTex there is no need for UV unwrapping anymore.</p>
<p>In addition, Subdivs support localized levels of subdivision. What that means is that the whole pipeline can work with the coarse base mesh. The modeler can then go into specific sections that need more definition, locally subdivide that area and make modeling changes there. Those will be saved and applied at render time. Bill showed an example of that at work. In Brave, which was originally supposed to play in winter, they had Merida&rsquo;s horse run through a snowy plane. The plane itself had a resolution of about a vertex per square meter. Enough resolution to model snow drifts. However, for the horse&rsquo;s path they locally increased the planes resolution to one square centimeter at render time to capture the fine detail of hooves disturbing the snowy surface.</p>
<h1 id="at-rendertime">At rendertime</h1>
<p>The term &ldquo;at rendertime&rdquo; is misleading, because Pixar is now using a GPU implementation of the subdiv algorithm. The implications of that are far reaching.</p>
<p>At the simplest level &ldquo;at rendertime&rdquo; in the paragraph before means, the animator gets a live preview of those several hundred thousand faces in real time in the viewport (Maya&rsquo;s Viewport 2.0 in this case, which has OpenSubdiv support built in already). Let me restate that, we saw a demo of a &ldquo;low poly&rdquo; mesh with about 3000 faces animated with bones that had the OpenSubdiv algorithm applied. What we saw on screen were about 3.8 million faces animated in real time. And since Subdivs have the added benefit of getting displacement at hardly any additional cost, those 4 million polygons were displaced as well. Very intriguing stuff.</p>
<p>This is not only interesting for VFX though. Since this realities GPU implementation also means games that adopt this will get much more visually complex. And in fact, while Bill could not mention any names, he went out of his way to let us know that <em>major mobile company that produces very popular devices we all own and with the power to dictate the chip manufacturers what to put into their chips</em> will implement hardware OpenSubdiv support within the year. Or as Bill put it, <em>you will likely have devices with hardware support built in the next time you see me</em>.</p>
<h1 id="good-for-pixar-how-do-i-get-it">Good for Pixar. How do I get it?</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s the nice part. You likely already have the technology available to you. For one OpenSubdiv is open source and all the licensing for the technology is available for free as well. Also, if you use Maya, you have access to all this already. Maya uses the exact same algorithm Pixar uses since Maya 5.0 and now also has the GPU implementation through Viewport 2.0.</p>
<p>So no excuses, get cranking!</p>

			 <p><em>This talk was very theory heavy with lots of formulas and photos of curves that summarize pretty badly. I still gave it a try here.</em></p>
<p>The session started with the history of camera tech. From the first wooden boxes with a hand crank.</p>
<p>A hand cranked camera had severe restrictions in that it obviously only could film where a human operator could go and there wasn&rsquo;t even adjustable focus. Since then we have come a long way. Huge VistaVision camera rigs, car cranes with two seat at the top end of the crane (Titan crane) and Technocranes, which was the first camera crane that didn&rsquo;t need someone to look through the lens allowing much greater range of camera freedom. This was thanks to Jerry Lewis idea of a video feed.</p>
<p>After that came the motion control rigs, which not only allow repeatable motion to shot many matching passes of a shot, but also allow the combination of live footage with camera matched 3D footage or miniature footage.</p>
<h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting The Scene</h3>
<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s imperative to set up your film back accurately</li>
<li>after that setting the focal length should give you the correct field of view</li>
<li>you need to set up your nodal point on set correctly</li>
<li>live action usually is <strong>not</strong> nodal, meaning there is a parallax while panning</li>
<li>this must be matched  in the 3D camera</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="real-life-camera-motion-in-3d">Real Life Camera Motion In 3D</h3>
<p>Cameras must adhere to physics, which means there is a limit to the acceleration of an object. Not speed. Acceleration. Meaning sharp changes in speed, up or down, directional changes.</p>
<p>The acceleration can be derived by the second order derivative of the position change (translation curve). Ideally, you want your 3D curves to accelerate gradually with no more the 9.82 m/s or 1G. Some motion control sYstems can handle more or less.</p>
<p>Of course, there is also a certain speed limit involved.</p>
<h3 id="problems-capturing-live-motion-for-repeatability">Problems Capturing Live Motion For Repeatability</h3>
<p>A problem arises when you have a camera motion, usually SteadyCam shots, that you need to transform into a motion control shot. For example, you film your actors with a SteadyCam in a greenscreen setup and then you need to repeat that move with a motion control rig on a different set or a miniature.</p>
<p>The way to go about it is to match move (track) the shot, which will give you a rather noisy result, at least in motion control terms, which you won&rsquo;t be able to program. You can smooth the result, which will loose you accuracy, but enables you to program the shot. The trick is to filter enough, without leading to misalignment.</p>

			 <p>Not too much to record for this one. It was mostly company heads trying to weasel their way out of loaded questions by the audience and discussion chair Eric Roth. Things like &ldquo;Do you think a VFX union is a solution to the problems?&rdquo; &ldquo;‚Ä¶&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was interesting to see the panel stammer around the issue. But mostly it was sad that they still don&rsquo;t see that they are a part of the issue. Companies not standing up and showing some balls.</p>
<p>Example: Pixomondo&rsquo;s Chris Vogt agreeing that tax incentives are part of the issue, while not disclaiming that Pixomondo is pushing for tax credits here in the Stuttgart area. In fact, the papers are about to be signed within a month.</p>
<p>One of the last questions was good: &ldquo;If you had 30 million, would you invest it in VFX today?&rdquo; (After every panelist confirmed that they are feeling positive about the future of the industry.)
Not one would use the money to open a VFX company. Very telling. :)
Some suggested to invest it in a film fund.</p>
<p>Also, &ldquo;why do you keep working on a fixed cost model? That&rsquo;s insane.&rdquo;
A (summarized): &ldquo;We are no businessmen and also passionate. So it&rsquo;s mostly our fault, but it&rsquo;s likely not going to change since our clients won&rsquo;t go for a cost plus model.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Opening with a joke about the botched Oscar ceremony, this is promising to be a good yet sad talk. Rhythm &amp; Hues went from 1000 artists to a small fraction of that recently.</p>
<h3 id="why-was-life-of-pi-unfilmable">Why was Life of Pi &ldquo;unfilmable&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Three simple reasons, combined making for a perfect storm:</p>
<ul>
<li>water</li>
<li>animals</li>
<li>kids (the actor playing <em>Pi</em> while technically not a kid played his first role and could not swim)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>Ang Lee did some hands on research of how a life boat or raft behaves in the ocean and how water and waves behave. Authenticity was paramount.</p>
<p>A pool with a wave machine was built in addition to an extensive set of 3D shaders mimicking the pool water. The water had to blend with the CG seamlessly.</p>
<h3 id="water-shading">Water Shading</h3>
<ul>
<li>custom, physically plausible water shader</li>
<li>a set of five different water noises to layer and mix the water as needed
<ul>
<li>to avoid tiling a set of noise patterns was used to multiply the effects of the water noise parameters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>once water was dialed in, it was <strong>locked</strong> and 3D artists couldn&rsquo;t change it and needed to adjust the scene to get the desired effect</li>
<li>and of course, physical accuracy went out the window as soon as we reach the comp stage or when the director wants the water different then the physical simulation says it should look</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="skies">Skies</h3>
<p>About 140 different extremely high‚Äìres HDRi skies were shot and and artists could pick and choose crop outs</p>
<h3 id="meerkat-island">Meerkat Island</h3>
<ul>
<li>one giant single Banyan tree system with about 6 billion polys per frame</li>
<li>up to 45000 meerkats in one shot done with Massive</li>
<li>up to 10000 in the shot</li>
<li>basically only Pi is real, the island is CG</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="richard-parker-the-tiger">Richard Parker, the tiger</h3>
<ul>
<li>subsurface on the fur</li>
<li>new muscle system</li>
<li>not anthropomorphized at all</li>
<li>based on a real tiger, &ldquo;King&rdquo;, from France, he appears in only 23 shots</li>
</ul>
<p>muscles simulation ‚Üí subcutaneous skin layer ‚Üí epidermis layer that slides over the top ‚Üí covered by fur</p>
<p>All that leads to the realistic wiggling, bouncing and sliding of ski that makes for a realistic animal.</p>
<p>10 million strands of hair lit with area lights, subsurface scattering</p>

			 <p>Topics discussed center around what the industry can do to improve interoperability and workflow to strengthen the business instead of running it into the ground.</p>
<h3 id="open-data-platforms">Open Data Platforms</h3>
<p>Rob Bredrow took the lead by talking about the work he and SPI has worked on to create a good open standard onto which companies can build to achieve something greater. Alembic, OpenColorIO, OpenEXR to name a few.</p>
<p>Before every company needed to reinvent the wheel in-house to set itself apart. Now they can work on a common standard which helps with interoperability between companies, which is something that is required in today&rsquo;s industry.</p>
<p>We have moved from &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo; to common baseline, which also includes the game industry. A convergence of VFX and games in this respect seems  inevitable to Cevat from CryTek.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;vector of cross-pollination for these industries&rdquo; were uttered. That should tell you pretty much everything you need to know.[^1]</p>
<h3 id="cloud-based-solutions">Cloud Based Solutions</h3>
<p>Cloud based computing power is something that is a topic everybody was interested in, even the big houses, who usually have several thousand render farm computers of their own. There are immense draws to this kind of workflow. From lower overheads, due to savings on machine, administration and licensing costs to being able to ramp up render power quickly when you need it during a deadline crunch.</p>
<p>This interest is something that is shared equally between small studios like ours and the big boys. And only expected to expand in the coming years. Ludwig von Reiche talked a bit about cloud computing applications in development, running on Amazon Elastic Computing among others, which he expects to come out within the next year.</p>
<p>While there are already solutions that offer Amazon Cloud rendering, they are usually cobbled together requiring a small science degree to figure out. We are talking about more accessible solutions.</p>
<p>Rob Bredrow argued that there are really two sides to cloud computing. One is the reduced cost due to less inventory and running costs. The other side is to add a lot of render power on demand, say 1000 or more machines to render a shot in an afternoon. That might cost more, but speeds up the creative cycle and might be worth it from that perspective.</p>
<p>[1]: That&rsquo;s around where I got bored and lost a bit track of the conversation.</p>

			 <p>Starting out with a short overview of RiseFX, his company, Florian dove right into the workflow for Cloud Atlas. RiseFX has garnered a reputation for using innovative approaches to set extensions and they didn&rsquo;t disappoint on Cloud Atlas either.</p>
<p>Starting out with some stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>most expensive German movie to date at 100 million US dollars</li>
<li>financed independently internationally</li>
<li>lots of famous actors in multiple wildly different roles</li>
<li>shot only in European locations standing in for totally different environments</li>
<li>pre‚Äìproduction started July 2011 with the previz of 1973 San Fransisco and the Luisa Rey car crash</li>
<li>shooting started in August</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="car-crash">Car Crash</h1>
<p>The previz was very accurately planned and is pretty much verbatim like that in the movie.</p>
<p>Filmed on a bridge in Scotland, which lead to major cleanup work as the bridge was supposed to lead to an island not to mention be in San Francisco. A major challenge was that it plays at night with various camera crane moves showing kilometers of street environment. While you could in theory light that set, there would be huge amounts of lights, power and therefor budget involved.</p>
<p>So the guys went ahead, shot her on the backlot of Rise in Berlin in front of a blue-screen. For the bridge, they made a 3D scan of the environment that got them a textured and completely relightable.  Easy.</p>
<p>The crash itself was filmed on a gimbal with added CG trash elements floating around giving a zero gravity effect.</p>
<p>The car crashing into Halle Berry&rsquo;s car was a 3D car for a simple reason. The director liked the movement of the car in a specified shot, which was unfortunately unusable due to plate errors. So the car was modeled and textured based of all the different takes. Then the preferred shots car was match moved and the 3D car placed into the shot.</p>
<h1 id="plane-crash">Plane Crash</h1>
<p>The plane crash was a pretty straightforward Houdini simulation. However, for this project RiseFX adapted a 100% Houdini approach, unlike what most other companies do, simulate in Houdini and model, animate and render in another package. This approach saved the, a lot of headaches as everything could interact and be rendered in the same package.</p>
<p>Which means for the plane explosion that not only could the simulation influence the fluid simulation, but also they could light the geometry with the fluid simulation. Meaning the explosion light everything physically correctly including all the small debris.</p>
<h1 id="lots-of-environment-reprojection">Lots of environment re‚Äìprojection</h1>
<p>Having all the sets as Lidar 3D scans meant that they could very easily redress entires sets and just replace them with the 3D model. It also made relighting a lot easier.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening was the first of likely many fxphd meetups this week. About 15 people showed up and had a relaxed chat. It was a great time to catch up with old friends and meet new faces.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Movies were discussed, Schnitzels eaten and some teased (twitter: johnmontfx text: John Montgomery), who sadly couldn&rsquo;t make it this year, with pictures of delicious wheat beer like the cruel friend we are.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All in all it was great seeing everyone again and to have some light non-FMX, but of course still VFX chat.</p>

			 <p>Next week is <a href="http://www.fmx.de">FMX</a>, a great yearly convention about visual effects, games and virtual reality. I&rsquo;m there every year reporting for Professional Production Magazine and I thought this year I could up my game and write little short blurbs on this blog about the sessions I attend. I asked around and there was some interest from people that could not make it this year or which are interested in the topic.</p>
<p>So far so good. There was only one problem. I switched to using <a href="http://getkirby.com">Kirby</a> as the back end system of all my websites including this blog. Kirby is a great lightweight system for web publishing. Only, because it is still so young, it doesn&rsquo;t have a mobile client that allows you to create posts or pages easily. True, it comes with an admin panel, but that doesn&rsquo;t work offline and it also doesn&rsquo;t work on my iPhone. So I was looking for something that better suited my needs. And I had a first version working.‚Äî</p>
<h2 id="drafts-dropbox-hazel-rsync-easy-really">Drafts, Dropbox, Hazel, Rsync. Easy, really.</h2>
<p>Since I only had a few hours here and there, it is still really rough and not as elegant as I&rsquo;d like, but it works. I am now able to use <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts">Drafts</a> to compose my posts on either my iPad or my iPhone, or start on one and finish on the other, since notes are always kept in sync, send the post to <em>Dropbox</em> via Draft&rsquo;s custom Dropbox actions where it is picked up by <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a>, renamed to fit my Kirby naming convention, put into the right folder and then uploaded via <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">Rsync</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pictures-work-too">Pictures work, too</h2>
<p>So much for plain text posts. But pictures work, too. Though they are still very much a pain. iOS' default camera app records the orientation of the device as EXIF data, so portrait orientation pictures are not actually rotated, but the EXIF Orientation is set to 90¬∞ or -90¬∞. Which is all nice and fine, except Safari, and a few other browsers, disregard the EXIF orientation, so images appear in landscape on my site after I upload them. That sucks. The only way around that is to either do <em>anything</em> to the image in Camera+ or another photo editor and save the result, which bakes the rotation into the image. Or to write a function in Hazel that bakes the orientation into the image after I upload it to Dropbox. I&rsquo;m probably going to go with the latter, since I&rsquo;m trying to save battery life and using Camera+ a lot sucks down battery life quite a bit.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. To get my images up to Dropbox I use a great little app called <a href="http://homegrownsw.com/camerasync/">CameraSync</a>, which has Geofencing support, meaning I don&rsquo;t have to do anything to upload the picture to a folder of my choosing on Dropbox. Also, and this is the killer feature, it resizes them before the upload, saving me time and bandwidth.</p>
<p>The biggest pain from here is that I still need to manually move the images into my blog posts folder and rename them from <em>somename‚Äìtimestamp.jpg</em> to the naming I use for images in my blog. I have not found a smarter way to do it yet then to do it manually. As I said, the whole process is still rough around the edges.</p>

<p>At the moment, I am in Lyon, France to write about <a href="http://www.cartoon-media.be/MOVIE/index.php">Cartoon Movie 2009</a>. At this conference, motion picture and games are presented to investors and distributors. A wide range of animation styles and storylines is present, which makes the conference really interesting to watch. A lot of great and creative people come together to give each other feedback and to look for new ideas and opportunities. All in all it is an exciting melting pot of like-minded people.</p>
<p>I will be writing a two-page article about it for Professional Production magazine in Germany and probably will present an abridged version of it here when I am done with it. So keep watching this space for more info.</p>

The company size is considerably bigger then most companies I have worked so far and I have to handle several smaller projects instead of one or two big projects. That is a new challenge and I am looking forward to master it in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Being a part of Pixomondo makes me proud, as this is a very professional, yet cool company to work for. I have a chance to stay with them for a longer time if I am not messing up the first 1,5 test months. Wish me luck.</p>

<p>It is official now. The production of &ldquo;Prisoners of the Sun&rdquo; has been put on hold. All employees and freelancers have been laid of as of 30th April 2008.</p>
<p>According to rumors, it seems the legal situation of the movie was not researched thoroughly before going into post production.</p>
<p>It is a pity, because we were at a stage, where all the pipelines were set up and we just started our first two full CG shots. We were actually starting to have some good old VFX fun. But not anymore. Now we have 20 people hunting for jobs again.</p>
<p>It really makes me sad to give up a great little company. We had a killer team. Thanks to all of you for being so great.</p>

			 <p>I wanted to share this litte trick with you for quite a while now, but of course I have been busy and other things came in the way. They always do.</p>
<p>I work with my MacBook Pro at home and at the office. That is of course nice, because it is my only base of operations and I have everything in one place.</p>
<p>But do you know the feeling that you are working with your laptop at work and don‚Äôt want anyone to snoop around on it, because it also is your private laptop and has all kinds of personal stuff on it? I know I do.</p>
<p>Luckily there is an easy fix for that. Enable the setting that pops up a password request after your machine wakes from sleep or when it disables the screen saver. But now you always have to enter the password at home, too. Kind of annoying.</p>
<p>There is an easy fix for that as well. The key is location aware software like [MarcoPolo] <a href="http://www.symonds.id.au/marcopolo/">1</a>. MarcoPolo allows you to trigger certain actions depending on where it knows you are at the moment. Pretty cool stuff. That means it allows you to enable or disable the screen saver password at home or at work. Neat isn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>I made a little [screencast] [2] walking you through the steps. All you need is MarcoPolo which you can get for free from the [developers website] <a href="http://www.symonds.id.au/marcopolo/">1</a>.</p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt want to use MarcoPolo you can also use AppleScript to do the same thing with whatever software you prefer. In fact I used the scripts with MarcoPolo, because I overlooked the very convenient built-in action that already does that.</p>
<p>The AppleScripts are as follows:</p>
<p>####Enable Screen Saver Password</p>
<pre><code>tell application &quot;System Events&quot;
	tell security preferences
		get properties
		set properties to {require password to wake:true}
	end tell
end tell
</code></pre>
<p>####Disable Screen Saver Password</p>
<pre><code>tell application &quot;System Events&quot;
	tell security preferences
		get properties
		set properties to {require password to wake:false}
	end tell
end tell
</code></pre>
<p>Have a look at the screencast for more in-depth info.</p>

			 <p>Hello everyone,
I have to make a completely selfish plug for a movie I worked on lately. It is called Solo and is about Jon, the first winner of the Danish Popstars show. I don‚Äôt speak a word of Danish ‚Äî well, at least not enough to fully understand the movie ‚Äî but the critics seem to love it and it is a big success for us so far.</p>
<p>Me and my team worked on several things, some which made it into the final movie and some which ended up on the cutting floor. We had some nice effects and compositings in there, but the director decided that it is a documentary not an effects movie. A good decision if you ask me, although it is a pity the effects never me it into public.</p>
<p>What is left is a few name removals from signs and some other invisible effects to increase the quality of the material like degraining or resizing and reframing, etc.</p>
<p>We are shipping the DVD which has English subtitles (Yay! I finally can understand what I contributed to!!!) over the company website and through the normal DVD stores beginning of June. So just grab a copy and make the success even bigger, will ya?</p>

			 <p>A lot of times I hear people complaining how slow this or that program is. ‚Äúshake is so slow‚Äù, ‚Äúmotion is total crap‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy is this taking so long?‚Äù</p>
<p>Well, guess what, there is actually a solution to it. And the magic word is <em>workflow</em>. We are working on pretty heavy projects most of the time. HD material (even if the output will be PAL in the end), 2K material for film or lots of layers or 3D layers. All that stuff is by definition slow. Especially if you work in a more complex setup then one or two layers. Add to that, that we are working in a network based environment and you get a workflow slow as molasses.</p>
<p>There are a few things you can to do help pretty much every program to work faster.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don‚Äôt work in full resolution</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt turn on all the effects, just because it looks better</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt work over the network</li>
<li>THINK before you work</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="dont-work-in-full-resolution">Don‚Äôt work in full resolution</h4>
<p>Yes, I know, you just built the most sexy motion graphics ever and you feel like looking at it over and over again, while tears run down your cheeks. Don‚Äôt.</p>
<p>Your first responsibility is to work as fast as you can, because that allows for making it even better and being more flexible when the customer has last minute changes. It is of little importance to look at your masterpiece in 100% resolution and highest quality most of the time. Don‚Äôt use these settings until you really need them to judge the final output quality.‚Ä®
For all other cases go ahead and turn down the display size to 50% and the display quality to a third or a proxy of a third. Some applications even offer the option to go one step lower in quality as soon as you move things around. Use that.</p>
<p>Another thing you should think about is the use of proxies. A proxy is a lower resolution version of your footage. So instead of working on HD material you work on PAL or half PAL material. After Effects and shake both support the automatic use of proxies. That means they automatically switch from low-res to high-res version as needed.
To see how that is done, have a look at the tutorial video, that describes it in more detail.</p>
<h4 id="dont-turn-on-all-the-effects-just-because-it-looks-better">Don‚Äôt turn on all the effects, just because it looks better</h4>
<p>Yes, that 3D lighting in AfterEffects is sexy. But if you are working on font sizes, it is absolutely irrelevant. So switch it off. Same goes for every other effect that slows you down, but has no effect on the part you are working on at the moment (Motion Blur, other kinds of blurs, re-timing, heavy 3D, particles, you name it). It is much faster to switch off 5 effects, do a change and switch them on again, then trying to make a change while waiting 5-10 seconds for the screen to update.</p>
<h4 id="dont-work-over-the-network">Don‚Äôt work over the network</h4>
<p>You might have a pretty fast network, but when 10-20 people work with HD or 2K footage over the network it slows down. Nothing that can be done about that. Except to copy your source material to a local drive. That will be way faster to work with then waiting for your bits and bytes to trickle through the cable.</p>
<h4 id="think-before-you-work">THINK before you work</h4>
<p>Seems pretty obvious, right? Try to think before you start working.</p>
<p>Working locally is fast. But if it takes 2 hours to copy footage to make a 10 minute change, then it might not be the most efficient way of working.</p>
<p>Generating proxies is cool if you work on a shot for several hours or days. But generating proxies takes time as well. It might be faster to just open a file, do a quick change and render it out again.</p>
<p>Assess the situation and act accordingly. But don‚Äôt get lazy!! If you see a benefit, do it!</p>

		<a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2007/01/28/twitter-for-colloquy.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-01-28 16:10:06 &#43;0200">Jan 28, 2007</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I don‚Äôt know if you already know this service called [Twitter] <a href="http://twitter.com/">1</a>. It can be described as a IM independent status message, so you can notify people of your current doings if you like.</p>
<p>[Coda Hale] <a href="http://blog.codahale.com/">2</a> created a [Quicksilver action to post conveniently to Twitter] <a href="http://blog.codahale.com/2007/01/15/tweet-twitter-quicksilver/">3</a>. [Ted Leung] <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/">4</a> thought it would be nice to have [Growl notifications] <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2007/01/18/growlified-tweet/">5</a> in the mix and [Matt Matteson] <a href="http://dlzip.com/wordpress/">6</a> thought it needed a bit more sparkle by [adding iChat support] <a href="http://dlzip.com/wordpress/2007/01/19/tweeter-twitter-quicksilver-ichat/">7</a>. Well, now I add two more options to the mix.</p>
<p>First I created a modified version of Mattesons‚Äô script to work with [Colloquy] <a href="http://colloquy.info/">8</a> ‚Äî my favourite IRC chat client (Which I also use for IQC, MSN, Jabber and IRC via the help of [BitlBee] <a href="http://www.bitlbee.org/">9</a>). This worked out pretty straightforward and nice ‚Äî and can be downloaded here (for setup instructions go to [Coda Hale‚Äôs page] <a href="http://blog.codahale.com/2007/01/15/tweet-twitter-quicksilver/">3</a>). But then I thought it is stupid to have to change my status message of my chat client outside my chat client. So I sat down a little while longer and created a Colloquy script that posts to Twitter ‚Äî including Growl notifications.</p>
<p>This script works like the normal <code>/me</code>¬ù commands in IRC but also posts the text behind the <code>/me</code> command to Twitter. Users of Colloquy should know what it does, but for you non-IRC people, <code>/me</code> creates an _action_¬ù message so <code>/me is hungry</code>¬ù becomes <em>AlexK (my nickname) is hungry</em>. And on [Twitter] <a href="http://twitter.com/">1</a> it says _AlexK (my username there) is hungry_¬ù. It makes perfect sense (to me at least).</p>
<p>###How to install</p>
<p>To install it download this file, unpack it and save it as twitter.scpt into your Colloquy plugins folder (~/Library/Application Support/Colloquy/Plugins/twitter.scpt), then restart Colloquy (on some machines a system restart was necessary for unknown reasons).</p>
<p>Then you need to configure it. If you‚Äôre not already using [Twitterrific] <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific/index.html">10</a>, open Keychain Access and add a new password with the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keychain Item Name: <a href="http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a></li>
<li>Account Name: Your email address</li>
<li>Password: Your Twitter password</li>
</ul>
<p>If you‚Äôre already using Twitterrific, this password will already be in your Keychain. So just sit tight.</p>
<p>Now you can use it with the commands <code>/tweet</code>¬ù or <code>/twitter</code>¬ù like so <code>/tweet is testing out this cool plugin</code>¬ù. It should send and action message to your current chatroom (Nickname is testing out this cool plugin) and also to your Twitter account (Username is testing out this cool plugin). After it succeeded you will get a Growl notification.</p>
<p>On first use you will be asked if it is ok that the script gets access to your Keychain. This is fine and you should allow that. On first usage it might also take a little bit longer, but from then on it should run pretty fast. At least it does so over here.</p>
<p>###Caveats</p>
<p>I have one guy who had problems with it running very slow (up to 15 seconds), but over here is runs pretty much realtime. Of course it has to send data over the internet, so that might be a slowdown factor. I guess if you like just try it out.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> [Jesse Newland] <a href="http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/">11</a> linked the slowness to AppleScript needing a lot of time to access the Keychain in some cases. Maybe a bug on Apple‚Äôs side? Anyway he suggest to [use Rubygems to work around this] <a href="http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/articles/2007/01/22/tweet-update-twitter-via-quicksilver">12</a>. Thanks for that workaround, but I am not too hot on installing an extra piece of software just for this. But for all of you out there who have problems with my Colloquy/Twitter script being slow this might be a viable solution.</p>
<p>And as always with this home-brewn scripts, I cannot give any guarantee that it works and I also distance myself from any damage done by it. It works great over here, but I cannot guarantee this for your setup. That is all I can say.</p>
<p>###Following are comments from the old blog</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blaine Says:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nice. It‚Äôs very cool to see twitter inching its way into every nook and cranny of the desktop and not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Any particular reason you didn‚Äôt use Bitlbee‚Äôs Jabber integration to help you out?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Alexander Kucera Says:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, two reasons Blaine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I hardly use Jabber these days</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When I use the Jabber route I am locked in to using Jabber</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me explain the second one.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let‚Äôs say I am in an IRC channel. I‚Äôd have to switch the room to a Jabber connection to send my message to the twitter user.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With my script I am independent of the room I am in. It just intercepts the command and send it to Twitter. I don‚Äôt have to think about sending it to a specific user or anything else. I just type my command and it sends.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Very easy, very ‚Äúout of my way‚Äù. I like to keep it simple, otherwise I end up not using it.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Rinoa Says:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Found you on digg. Have you considered having your script submitted on the Colloquy website?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Alexander Kucera Says:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Riona,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted it to be tested by a few more people before making it an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù part of the Colloquy site. But yes, I am definitely thinking about submitting it.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Blaine Says:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That makes sense. I didn‚Äôt realize Bitlbee was presented as an independent room in IRC.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep up the good work, and let us know (<a href="mailto:help@twitter.com">help@twitter.com</a>) if there‚Äôs anything we can do to improve twitter!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2006/11/27/naming-conventions-part.html">Naming Conventions - Part 02 - Real Life Application</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2006/11/27/naming-conventions-part.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2006-11-27 16:10:06 &#43;0200">Nov 27, 2006</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last time I talked about the basic ingredients of a working naming convention, which got inspired by a topic covered on [Lifehacker] <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/file-management/ask-the-readers-filing-naming-conventions-210104.php">1</a> and [43 Folders] <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/10/23/file-naming/">2</a>. What to avoid ‚Äî like never using the word ‚Äúfinal‚Äù in any circumstances ‚Äî and what to include ‚Äî for example version numbers.</p>
<p>This time I will show you how to use this new gained knowledge and plug its elements together into a working template for a professional naming convention. Just read on to find out how it‚Äôs done.</p>
<p>###The Template</p>
<p>Actually it is very simple. Take what we have spoken about last time and plug the elements together to get a working naming convention, like this (this might wrap a bit unlucky, if so just wait till we get to the real life example ‚Äî which reads more easily ‚Äî two lines further down):</p>
<p><code>&lt;project-name&gt;_&lt;file-content&gt;_&lt;version-number&gt;_&lt;changes to the version before&gt;_&lt;author&gt;.&lt;file-extension&gt;</code></p>
<p>Easy, isn‚Äôt it? So in a more lifelike example we get:</p>
<p><code>ambul_keying-Shot012_03_fixedMaskIssue_AlexK.mov</code></p>
<p>This file is part of the project called ‚ÄúThe Ambulance‚Äù and it contains the greenscreen keying and compositing for shot 012 and is in it‚Äôs third revision. The change to the last version is a fix in one of the masks (which probably was wrong in version 02) and the change was done by me.</p>
<p>###It sorts in groups‚Ä¶</p>
<p>As you can see this is a pretty human-readable filename. And just from looking at it we can see what is going on. And because of the way we built the filename it sorts correctly when we sort by filename in the file-browser. We will always see the shots for the project ‚Äúambul‚Äù together, followed by all versions of keying shots, then the individual shots in order and then the individual versions of a shot.</p>
<p>And if you ever accidentally save your file in the wrong folder(another project or your local drive instead of the projects drive), it becomes pretty easy to find again, because it includes the project name.</p>
<p>###‚Ä¶and is extensible</p>
<p>The nice thing about this order is that we can now add as many additional informations to the filename as we deem necessary after the version number ‚Äî like in this case the changes to the last version and the authors name. We will always get it sorted in the right way, because the version number comes first in the filename.</p>
<p>And we also need not worry about including the date in the filename directly in most cases, because the operating system takes care of this automatically.</p>
<p><strong>There is not one correct way ‚Äî the template adjusts to your taste</strong></p>
<p>There are of course many different options to express the same information as above. We could also write any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ambulance_keyingShot012_
_version03_fixedMaskIssue_AlexanderKucera.mov</li>
<li>amb_gskS012_03_fixMask_AK.mov</li>
<li>ambul.keying_Shot-012.03.fixedMask.AlexK.mov</li>
<li>ambul-keying shot 012-v03-fixed mask issue-AlexK.mov</li>
</ul>
<p>All these versions contain the same info. Some are more verbose, others less. Some are easier to read, others less. I tend to stick with underscores to divide the individual chunks of information and dashes or a combination of small and capital letters to make the individual chunks more readable. This comes from my programming history. If other schemes are easier to read for you, take them instead.
This part is completely up to your taste and doesn‚Äôt influence the effectiveness of this naming convention as long as you always use the same method.</p>
<p>###Do yourself a favor ‚Äî stick to it</p>
<p>Stick to it once you have a working naming convention. And please don‚Äôt try to change it after every project. You will be thankful for sticking with it when that project resurfaces after a month or a year.</p>
<p>If you have questions or suggestions about my way of naming files please leave a comment. I‚Äôd love to read about your ways of tackling this issue.</p>

<p>Do you know filenames like this? Or even worse, do you still use them? I did too. But I learned how to avoid these ugly names that no one can decipher 5 minutes later. And in this two parts series ‚Äî that got inspired by a topic covered on [Lifehacker] <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/file-management/ask-the-readers-filing-naming-conventions-210104.php">1</a> and [43 Folders] <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/10/23/file-naming/">2</a> ‚Äî I will show you how you can get a clean working naming convention, too. Just read on. It will take less then 5 minutes ‚Äî promise.</p>
<p>First I will show you what to look out for in naming files and in the seconds part I will show you an example of how we use this new gained information to create a consistent naming template that is production ready and proven to work, because I and my company used it successfully for years.</p>
<p>###What you should know ‚Äî The Basics</p>
<p>The most important thing about our files is the content, right? And in a project we need to make different versions of that content so we can easily recover after a crash or go back to an earlier version ‚Äî a version that maybe worked better or one that now fits better into the directors concept. How do we go about naming this content so we can easily see what we are dealing with?</p>
<ul>
<li>never ever use the word ‚Äúfinal‚Äù for any file</li>
<li>do not put too much information in the filename</li>
<li>put much info in your filename</li>
<li>number your files incrementally ‚Äî always</li>
<li>stick to your naming convention</li>
</ul>
<p>###Never ever use the word ‚Äúfinal‚Äù for any file</p>
<p>Well, plain and simple: never use the word ‚Äúfinal‚Äù as an integral part of the filename. For the simple reason that it never will be the final version. And what do you do then? Name your file ‚Äúfinal_final‚Äù? Or ‚Äúmore_final‚Äù? It just won‚Äôt work out, so just don‚Äôt do it. Simple isn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>Oh and while we are at it, try not to use these words either:</p>
<ul>
<li>temp</li>
<li>test</li>
<li>preview</li>
</ul>
<p>###Do not put too much information in the filename</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know about you, but when I want to read a story, I read a book. But when I am working I need to know which file is containing what ‚Äî fast. That means the filename should only contain what is necessary to communicate its content. Nothing more. But most importantly nothing less, which leads us to the next point.</p>
<p>###Put much information in your filename</p>
<p>Well, as I wrote above, when you look at a file in your file-browser you need to see instantly ‚Äî without opening the file ‚Äî what it contains. For that you need to put all the important info into the filename.<br>
But what is important you ask? Well, that certainly depends to a degree on your working environment and projects. A few things stay the same nevertheless. Lets make a small list. We normally need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>what project this file belongs to</li>
<li>what the file contains</li>
<li>who created the file (in a multi-user workspace)</li>
<li>which version it is</li>
<li>what changed to the version before it</li>
<li>when it was created</li>
</ul>
<p>There you have it. Not an awful lot, isn‚Äôt it? To see how we squeeze all that info in a short and readable filename read on.</p>
<p>There are two ways to tackle this. One is to use shortcuts like the first letters of your project (MIB = Men in Black), the other one is to use plain readable text. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.<br>
Shortcuts make filenames shorter and for the duration of the project probably also more readable (because you can see more of the information in a filename at once). On the other hand it will be probably pretty hard to decipher what a filename was meant to mean after a month or two when you have to revisit a project.</p>
<p>I tend to use a mix of both to get something as descriptive but short as possible.</p>
<p>###Number your files incrementally ‚Äî always</p>
<p>This is also an important one. Always number your files starting with 01, not 1, but 01, because you never know, it might end up being the first of many drafts before the final ‚Äî or, to stay consistent with our rule about not using the word ‚Äúfinal‚Äù ‚Äî the version that we end up using. So to avoid ugly constructs like version 2b5-new, we just stick to simple numbers 01, 02, 03 and so on. The recent version wasn‚Äôt good? No problem, make a new one and increase the version count. That leaves you with room for up to 99 versions, enough for even the most error and revision prone projects.</p>
<p>###Stick to your naming convention</p>
<p>Well, this seems to be obvious, but it isn‚Äôt very easy, especially in a working environment that has no rules about files names. Co-workers don‚Äôt use it, so why should you? To stay on top of the chaos and to lead by example. Once your co-workers see how easy and efficient a working naming convention can be they hopefully will switch to it, too.</p>
<p>I hope this was some useful info and if you wan to find out how we transfer this knowledge into a real life naming convention, then come back next week when I show you how I tend to use it.</p>
<p>Also please let me know what you think about this topic in the comments. Until then, take your work to the next level.</p>

			 <p>We met our new interns today and they all seemed very nice. One of them made a little bad impression though. Not only was he new in the company, but he also made bold statements about his future work. And he had never touched that area before, so what he said was either over the top or just wrong. Both things made him look like an arrogant guy or someone who has no clue at all (I am not sure which one fits better).</p>
<p>I think he could have avoided that hint of a bad impression with a little reality check before opening his mouth. He was the new guy, so the first thing he said should not have been to disagree with the two residents of our company who do this job for over two years now. At least not about a thing he obviously has no clue about. So before you start braging, check first how things in your future work environment work. And even if you think, you know better then all the guys, who did this job way longer then you, there are smarter ways to show you know something. Don‚Äôt make a statement. Formulate a question.</p>
<p>For example, instead of ‚ÄúTo do job X like that isn‚Äôt smart, because that will give you crappy quality‚Äù, try to formulate it as a question that doesn‚Äôt insult your conversation partner (even if you think you are right). Say something like ‚ÄúI heard, that doing job X like this means loosing quality. Is that right or did you find a way around it?‚Äù. It‚Äôs a win-win situation.</p>
<p>If you are right about it, your (probably more experienced) future co-workers, will be impressed because although you never worked in the area you have done your homework.
If you are wrong, you don‚Äôt make the impression of someone who didn‚Äôt do his homework, because you didn‚Äôt make a statement, you asked a question. And because you asked a question, you also have the chance to learn, because what you will now get is <em>an answer</em>.</p>
<p>Of course this basically is true for every situation where you come into a group of people. You first should find out where you stand before you burn bridges.</p>
<p>I just had to get this off my chest.</p>

			 <p>It seems like a niche market that had to be filled sooner or later. After Apples decision to quit the development ‚Äî and with it the support and maintenance ‚Äî of shake with version 4.1, there is a big hole in the support area of shake. Of course, there are the normal forums like [fxshare] <a href="http://www.fxshare.com/">1</a> (formerly highend2d) or [cgTalk] <a href="http://www.cgtalk.com/">2</a>, but for deep down support it is always nice to have the developers at hand, because only they know, what really goes on inside the code.</p>
<p>Well, I was not the only one who had that thought. Billy Woody, the primary support engineer from Apple, said goodby to Apple and hello to the shake community. He will be supporting shake users from his new base at [shakesupport.com] <a href="http://www.shakesupport.com/">3</a>.</p>
<p>Shakesupport.com offers quite a good deal compared to the $1499,- a year one had to pay for Apples shake support. Woody offers a similar support for only a fraction of that, beginning at $100,- a year (for a single license and people who subscribe until 1st November 2006) up to a cheap $1000,- per year for the big houses with 51 and more licenses.</p>
<p>Woody will probably be quite busy, considering the price drop opened up shake for a whole new audience of users. But these users also will have to struggle with the user interface, which is not exactly made for the casual user. So I see a golden road ahead of Woody and wish him all the best for this project. Shake will probably keep him busy for quite some time, even after the shake successor comes out.</p>

			 <p>Yes, you understood it correctly. [Messiah] <a href="http://www.projectmessiah.com/">1</a> is able to run on the [new Intel Macs] <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/">2</a>. And I am not talking about [BootCamp] <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">3</a> here fellows. I am talking about not having to restart your Mac to run Messiah. Being able to check mail or work in your favourite Mac application and simultaneously running the 3D character animation software Messiah. Don‚Äôt believe me? Here is the proof:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What you see on the above image is Messiah running on [an emulated Windows environment called Parallels Workstation] <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">4</a>. Take a look at the FPS counter in the perspective view of Messiah. It runs realtime and blazingly fast!! I nearly died of excitement yesterday seeing this. Everything looks great and fast and‚Ä¶ I am getting goose bumps again.</p>
<p>It runs perfect from a performance point of view as far as I can tell. Unfortunately my PC just died and I have no real test scenes available. So if someone has a nice and heavy scene for me to test on the virtualized Messiah - please be my guest. I‚Äôd love to test it out further.</p>
<p>One downside exists, however. The mouse input seems kind of broken. Whenever I try to change values by dragging (a slider in the properties tabs, the edit sphere, the perspective view) Messiah only adds the numbers in one direction. Meaning, when I increase the x translate and then drag in the other direction to decrease it, the value doesn‚Äôt decrease but just increases further. This could be a real show stopper, if it stays unresolved.<br>
But I am sure some smart guy out there finds a solution.</p>
<p>Update: Check out my screen capture of Messiah running under OS X.</p>

<p>No, this version is not accelerated. It is the same 15 day trial you can download for yourself torncanvas. No tricks, no bells and whistles. I didn‚Äôt even install any Windows update.

			 <p>Well, guess what? As I already thought it would happen, some people don‚Äôt seem to like the conclusions of my test. Zealots are so easy to predict and so hard to please.</p>
<p>####‚ÄúYou cannot do it like this. Testing the renderers with a simple teapot in the scene is totally unfair!‚Äù</p>
<p>Well, huh? How can a teapot be unfair? It is a simple geometry for crying out loud! If I had used a sphere or a torus (something not obviously produced by Pixar) it wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference.</p>
<p>####‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt use the right MotionBlur Settings, that is unfair!‚Äù</p>
<p>Well, true, MentalRay also has something called Rapid Motion Blur. But that sucks too. I didn‚Äôt include it for two reasons. (1) It sucks. Or in a longer version: Every time I tried it, I got major render artifacts, so I just didn‚Äôt consider it for this test. (2) It sucks. Longer version: It is still way slower then Renderman for Maya.
Well, my bad, I should have included it for sake of comparison.</p>
<p>####‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt tweak MentalRay right, there is way more to tweak to make it faster!‚Äù</p>
<p>Well, it wasn‚Äôt part of this test to find out which renderer I can waste the most time with. In my business it is important to get results fast. Every minute spent at tweaking render times is nearly the same as rendering a slow renderer. Because if I spent two hours at tweaking or loose two hours due to bad render settings doesn‚Äôt matter. In the commercial business I have to deliver. Fast.</p>
<p>In my tests there was nearly no tweaking involved for Renderman (which I knew nothing about before these tests), but quite a bit to make MentalRay to look even that good (which I have worked with for quite some time now). In my book that means MentalRay is slower (and yes slower means also that it has more knobs to tweak it and loose time in the process).</p>
<p>####‚ÄúSure Renderman is great, but Renderman for Maya is a completely different product. You can‚Äôt compare that!‚Äù</p>
<p>Well, yes and no. It is about RfM, but the only difference to PRman is the interface and what you can do with it. The rendering engine is 100% the same. So what goes for one, goes for the other, too. With the addition that PRman is more configurable.
Same goes for MentalRay for Maya. It is an interface for the MentalRay renderer. As such you have a small subset of what is possible in a point and click way. I tested this point and click way. Not any nifty shaders and special moves (which you can do with both RfM and MentalRay for Maya by the way).</p>
<p>Anyway, the results are the same, no matter how you turn it. MentalRay has it‚Äôs niche in the raytracing hyper-realism section, where there is no need for motion blur or fast displacements. But as far as good production value goes for day to day projects in a commercial environment (and for movies too as far as the general knowledge goes) Renderman is still superior. It is fast and easy to tweak (especially the RfM plugin) and gives fast and superior results.</p>

<p>man, how can you render in RfM without errors and hours of tweaking? this is one thing I‚Äôm strugling with right now, that I keep having all kinds of weird issues, errors, and such, and I manage to debug it in the end, but at the cost of losing many-a-neuron  one other question, as I actually started a quest of trying to figure out the mistery behind the allmighty render-passes in RfM. how do you‚Ä¶ do it? that tab in the render settings is alien technology for me right now, any tutorials, advices, anything?

<p>thanks alex,
could you give me a simple example of how you‚Äôd set up a shadow pass? I just need to render my shadows separately, that‚Äôs all. I haven‚Äôt touched passes until now‚Ä¶ and they seem very simple, but amazingly ilogical, meaning that whatever I do, more-or-less-nothing works  now don‚Äôt tell me I‚Äôm stupid, please, because you have to admit there are weird things in rfm, like tweaking that alpha gain when rendering displacement‚Ä¶ could they make it any more obscure? so what‚Äôs the secret behind rendering these passes anyway? it looks to me like I can only set up one pass‚Ä¶ and it renders that pass, like the shadow pass‚Ä¶ plus a beauty pass. I haven‚Äôt tried anything else yet. I presume it can render a diffuse pass plus the beauty pass, hehehe. because each time I try adding a different pass, it replaces my previous work‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt see that it‚Äôs adding that pass to the sandwich, it‚Äôs replacing the earlier pass, that‚Äôs all. so I‚Äôm always left with only one pass. but how do you render 10 passes, and what if you don‚Äôt want that beauty pass?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and last thing would be that I worked really hard to get the shadow pass to work, and I don‚Äôt know how I did it. trying to emulate the process with a different file didn‚Äôt work. I really did the same thing‚Ä¶ I think‚Ä¶ like it works just when it feels like, hehehe. yeah, I know, I know, it‚Äôs simply my fault - I don‚Äôt understand it  well but then another fact is that with RAT, and RfM as well, an insignificant little detail that you miss can result in complete disaster at rendertime. very sensitive. and I get nothing for free‚Ä¶ well, with RfM I do  RfM is much friendlier, so instead of tweaking things for days‚Ä¶ I only need hours  but errors seem to be inevitable. all the time. I‚Äôm not a rendering specialist and I have no one here to set it up for me, so I do all this stuff by myself.</p>

			 <p>As so many people from the MentalRay community seem to have a big problem with my motion blur test - and only that is seems, they don‚Äôt even see the parts, where I said good things about MentalRay - here is a small update with new images and the supposedly faster Rapid Motion Blur of MentalRay.</p>
<p>Well, yes, I give you that Rapid Motion Blur is faster. But 19 minutes is still kind of slow in my book, especially with these artifacts Rapid Motion Blur introduced. But I am sure some MentalRay user will point me in the right direction how to get rid of them after reading this.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here is again a Renderman version for direct comparison. This time I even increased the sampling, so the Motion Blur is more smooth then before. Still considerably faster then MentalRay. 6 minutes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How about this, we render the GI pass and maybe some reflections in MentalRay and then use this pass in Renderman, where we give is nice and fast Motion Blur?</p>
<p>As I said before: This is not a ‚ÄúMy toy better then your toy!‚Äù comparison. It is a test to see when it makes sense to use which renderer. No, MentalRay is not the big daddy of all renderers. Neither is Renderman.</p>
<p>Need heavy GI and Reflections, but the scene is relatively static or doesn‚Äôt need Motion Blur for some reason? Hell, go with MentalRay any time! Even try it out on scenes without Raytracing. It might be faster then Renderman.</p>
<p>But when you need fast Displacements and/or Motion Blur, stay away from MentalRay and use Renderman (or blur in post when the scene allows it).</p>
<p>This is all about getting the job done. And I published this test to give some people hints about what to use when, as this is still a very often asked question, even more so with the new RfM plugin.</p>
<p>People where interested, when I showed them this comparison and therefor, I made it available to a wider audience. ‚Ä¶which of course took it apart and missed the point completely. But that was to be expected.</p>
<p>Anyway before I drift into an endless monologue I better stop.</p>
<p>####Following are the comments from the old blog</p>
<blockquote>
<p>virgil Says:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You forget one thing. Renderman is not fast with motion blur (and depth of field) and displacement only, it‚Äôs especially fast with heavy scenes, it renders NURBS as pixels and it tesselates subdivisions very efficiently, so extremely heavy scenes, with a lot of geometry, textures, lights (but not shadows, shadows seem to be kind‚Äôa slow), and ideally without raytracing‚Ä¶ render very fast, where mental ray would probably take forever. if you compare 2 simple scenes and add raytracing, yes, mental ray is probably going to be faster. if you compare 2 simple scenes without raytracing, I can bet renderman is going to be faster. if you have a complex scene though‚Ä¶. with a lot of objects and shaders and so on, renderman will still be fast, while mental ray will be crawling, at best‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you can‚Äôt compare these 2 technologies like you‚Äôd compare 2 renderman renderers or maya-software-render and mental-ray. in renderman, if you build your set efficiently, not wasting polygons I mean, and trying to have as many NURBS surfaces as possible where possible, and also not using raytracing, but deep shadows and skillfully placed lights, and so on‚Ä¶ you can get a truly photographical render, with intricate surface detail and true dof and motion blur, all this in record time. mental ray is a fast raytracer and a very advanced and complex renderer, but in my book too‚Ä¶ mental ray is overall outrageously slow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>one truly great thing about renderman btw is you never have to worry about tessellation (haven‚Äôt we seen countless examples of faceted 3D CGI?), all smooth surfaces will be 100% smooth at any resolution, no matter how close to the camera. this alone was, for me, the reason to start learning RAT, and start using prman with Maya. If you also use procedural textures for example you can be totally resolution independent. this is BIG!</p>

<p>At first, Renderman is an scanliner and Mental Ray is a raytracer, so , obviously, renderman will be better in scanline tasks (shadow mpas, dof, motion blur,‚Ä¶) and render man is much better in raytracing tasks (relfections, refraction, GI,‚Ä¶)</p>

<p>I do not entirely see it that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Both renderers are hybrid-renderers nowadays. Only Renderman was first developed as a Scanline and MentalRay as a Raytrace renderer. And I don‚Äôt think that means MentalRay automatically has to be better at Raytracing. In fact for simple Scanline setups MentalRay beats Renderman. It is in the complexity of scenes that Renderman really collects its points. (A complexity which I didn‚Äôt even start to touch in my tests.)</p>

<p>I am also not sure if you read the real review, where I also list a few things where MR is better then Renderman. I don‚Äôt think however that Subsurface scattering is one on them though.</p>

<p>I mentioned several times in this and the old blog post (and the cgTalk forum) that MentalRay is better at Reflections and Refractions. I don‚Äôt see where I forgot that. Try reading my posts again.</p>

</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>masterblasterofdisaster Says:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A difficulty most people new to mental ray encounter is dealing with the maddening number of tweakable render parameters.<br>
For example, correct BSP settings alone can have a massive impact on the render time. In tuning the BSP, you‚Äôll find that the optimal settings versus ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù settings can affect the render time by several orders of a magnitude (in pathological cases, render times of 30 minutes versus several hours can be observed). A further difficulty is that good BSP depth and width values aren‚Äôt always easy to intuit: you‚Äôve often got to run tests and then decide what‚Äôs best. BSP values for motion blur will be different from non-motion blurred renders as well. If you run a test plotting render time against the axes ‚Äúdepth‚Äù and ‚Äúwidth‚Äù on a 3D graph (use excel, for instance), you‚Äôll find a bowl-like shape plotted out - the bottom of the bowl (ie lowest time) will indicate your optimal BSP settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I could go on‚Ä¶ there are many more tricks to know in order to properly and meaningfully compare the two renderers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My 2 cents: renderman is stuck in the 90‚Äôs - raytracing is essentially bolted on top of the fundamentally raytrace-unfriendly REYES architecture (ever wonder why the prman trace() function took over a decade to actually become implemented? It‚Äôs been in the prman specification from the beginning, after all!) If you don‚Äôt need raytracing and global illumination, then use it and enjoy, as it does all the old-school stuff quite well - however, prepare to make some ugly hacks in large scale production requiring tracing or other global illumination effects. Mental Ray certainly has it‚Äôs shortcomings, complexity being one, but as such it‚Äôs incredibly flexible and will get the job done. AIR is probably a good compromise, especially if you want a RIB compliant renderer that‚Äôll do all that stuff well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AlexK Says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey, nice input masterblasterofdisaster. Thanks for taking the time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually I think the complexity and thousands of knobs in MentalRay for Maya are the one thing that slow me down most. I need to produce my stuff fast (sometimes within hours), so I absolutely cannot waste time tweaking away. A thing that seems to be necessary with MentalRay (why oh why are the defaults so inefficient?).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course Renderman itself offers many possibilities, too, but the Renderman for Maya implementation is way less crowded and ‚Äújust works‚Äù (most of the time anyway).</p>

			 <p>Finally I found the time to do my little Renderman - MentalRay comparison. I used Maya 6.5 on a Mac OS X - which comes with MentalRay 3.4.1.5 and the Pixar Renderman for Maya plugin version 1.2 evaluation.</p>
<p>As test scenes, I used the tutorial scenes that come with the Renderman for Maya plugin. I am aware, that this might be a bit unfair to MentalRay, but my reasoning is that the features I tested should work in both renderers and the test scenes where not specifially pro Renderman anyway. I also tweaked the scenes to get the best out of Renderman <strong>and</strong> MentalRay, so as to not penalize either one.</p>
<p>The tested features where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Displacement</li>
<li>Motion Blur</li>
<li>Instances (as a side effect of the Motion Blur test)</li>
<li>Depth of Field</li>
<li>Fur and soft shadows</li>
<li>Reflections</li>
<li>Global Illumination</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Update:
MasterZap over at cgTalk pointed me to a few shortcomings in my tests.
First he is of the opinion, that I should have used MentalRay‚Äôs ‚ÄúRapid Motion Blur‚Äù. Every time I tested this feature, I either got artefacts or it was not significantly faster, so I just didn‚Äôt use it here.
Second, he points out that MentalRay has something similar to Renderman‚Äôs DeepShadow Maps. I forgot about them completely. My bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>###Displacement</p>
<p>Both renderers can handle really fine displacement really well. However, Renderman wins this contest hands down, as it does displacements with virtually no extra overhead. The surfaces get subdivided into Micropolygons anyway, so the renderer already has the neccessary geometry for displacment. MentalRay however doesn‚Äôt handle the large masses of geometry as well and it is much more hassle to tweak it (one has 4 different knobs per object to fiddle around with in MentalRay).</p>
<p>###Motion Blur‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Now Motion Blur is MentalRays (and most of the other renderers out there) Achilles heel. They just don‚Äôt cut it. Slow, grainy, memory intensive. That is the common knowledge about 3D Motion Blur.</p>
<p>This is definitely not true for Renderman. Man this renderer flies through it with a quality that is amazing! And the really nice thing about it is, that depending on the scene, Renderman gets even faster with Motion Blur. That is due to the fact, that one is able to give Renderman a second quality parameter for Motion Blur. So you just lower the quality where you won‚Äôt see it anyway (meaning in the blurry areas).</p>
<p>MentalRay on the other hand‚Ä¶just sucks‚Ä¶big time. No wonder people have such an expression of panic in their eyes, whenever rendered Motion Blur is the topic. If I didn‚Äôt know it better, I would not touch 3D Motion Blur either.</p>
<p>###‚Ä¶and Instances
Rendering the Motion Blur scene without blur, a severe bug in the Pixar plugin is revealed. It renders instances way slower then it should. That is a known bug and the big brother Pixar Renderman doesn‚Äôt suffer from this.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at the current time MentalRay wins this category easily and superfast.</p>
<p>###Depth of Field</p>
<p>Both engines work nearly the same here. Nothing special to report. Fast and nice.</p>
<p>###Fur and soft shadows</p>
<p>Well, this one I would say is a matter of personal taste. Renderman renders the fur best with DeepShadowMaps, which is like a shadow map, but with more bells and whistles. MentalRay doesn‚Äôt have DeepShadows and has to use Raytracing. That means, MentalRay shadows are always sharp and if you want them soft, you need more samples (=rendertime). The situation is the other way round with Renderman and DeepShadows. The default shadows look a bit blurry, but render fast and to increase the sharpness you have to increase the ShadowMap size and therefor increase rendertime.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a draw. If you like sharp shadows, go with MentalRay fur. If you like softer shadows (and I do, as real world shadows are never really sharp) go with Renderman.</p>
<p>###Reflections</p>
<p>Now we are entering the domain of MentalRay. It was built from the start as a Raytracing engine. And we can see that instantly in the rendertimes. Renderman however lived happily without Raytracing for ten years (or more) and has just recently (with version 11 I think) got the ability to trace rays.</p>
<p>###Global Illumination</p>
<p>Same here. MentalRay wins hands down. It feels right at home with tracing stuff.</p>
<p>###‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Remember the Motion Blur advantage? Well, it is even more evident with Raytracing. MentalRay may rule with Raytracing, but it is unbelieveably slow with Motion Blur. And it gets rediculous with Raytracing/Global Illumination and Motion Blur at the same time.</p>
<p>Renderman however, still slow, gets a big speed boost from lowering the quality in the blurred regions. Again fantastic!</p>
<p>###Fazit</p>
<p>So as a conclusion I would say, that both renderers have their areas where they shine and it would be a wise thing to know when to use which. All sympathies aside picking the best tool for the job. And if you do not need Motion Blur (or very subtle one that can be faked in post) go MentalRay, but for most other cases I would go Renderman any time.</p>

Well, since then I have seen a recent production called [‚ÄúElephants Dream‚Äú] <a href="http://www.elephantsdream.org/">1</a>, it is the first big project released, completely done with open source software, in particular [Blender] <a href="http://www.blender.org/cms/Home.2.0.html">2</a>, the open source 3D suite. It shows that Blender is able to produce nice stuff, but it also validates my thoughts concerning dull CG.</p>
<p>First, I didn‚Äôt get the story. That might not be my fault, but I was never a fan of these artistic movies. Have something to say? Better make sure people understand, what you are saying. Have nothing to say? Then shut up! But that is just me.</p>
<p>Second, the movie is everything I talked about last time. It tries to look realistic, but fails in doing so. And because it fails, all it‚Äôs flaws become all the more obvious. Sad but true. I was distracted by the stiffness of the characters all the time. And I mean not only in motion, but also in the looks. The makers tried to be so true to nature, that everything feels like true‚Ä¶plastic.</p>
<p>###So, is CG doomed to become more boring every day?</p>
<p>Luckily not. While I was very disappointed by the Blender movie, I also found some marvelous examples of animation from some French students (thanks to Peter Soderbaum from Passive/Agressive). These movies saved my day and more. They gave me hope again, that somewhere out there are still creative heads, that try do lift their work out of the ordinary. Go and take a look at [Burning Safari] <a href="http://www.gobelins.fr/galerie/animation/gen2006-1.htm">3</a>, a great funny short film. It has a great story, superb timing and a really nice look, that fits perfectly for the setting.</p>
<p>And while you are there, you should not miss [the other movies of this years students of Gobelins l‚Äôecole de l‚Äôimage] <a href="http://www.gobelins.fr/galerie/animation/annecy2006.htm">4</a>. I personally liked the Pirates movie best - even though it is not (plain) CG. But I just love the ending. Check it out -&gt; [Pyrats] <a href="http://www.gobelins.fr/galerie/animation/gen2006-3.htm">5</a></p>

			 <p>The [Doncaster Road End] <a href="http://doncaster-road-end.com/">1</a> blog has posted about the Infernal video we re-did for the world cup (you can read about it in one of my older posts). In [their post] <a href="http://doncaster-road-end.com/?p=134">2</a> they review several songs that were‚Ä¶ er‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ mutilated to make a quick buck of the world cup. ‚ÄúFrom London to Berlin‚Äù actually made a reasonable standing. Thanks guys!</p>
<p>I am aware that this was no high quality piece, but believe me, it was at least a challenge from the technical side. And I actually think it works better then the original version. In this new one the story tells better and clearer.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the review.</p>

			 <p>I thought it is time to show a little of the work we have done so far. All videos should play fine in Quicktime player version 7, but might also run in earlier versions, I didn‚Äôt test that.</p>
<p>The first project or a thing that is still in development, but is already used in production, Monika and I are developing a template for magazine commercials. This short clip shows a render test I did, which was also used to show off to potential customers.</p>

<p>The next two clips are show two projects we did both last week. The first shows a 3D CD-Cover for the Soccer Worldcup‚Äôs theme song Bob Sinclair‚Äôs ‚ÄúLove Generation‚Äù.</p>

<p>The second is a remake of the Infernal video ‚ÄúFrom Paris to Berlin‚Äù, which we remade for the Worldcup into ‚ÄúFrom London to Berlin‚Äù with a cartoon caricature of Wayne Rooney of the English top players.<br>
This was a real challenge, because we had to re-create the whole thing without the source materials. We only had the final product in uncompressed quality and a few Maya scene files. Quite a challenge for a one week project. What do you think about it Udo (if you ever see this)?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There are a lot of nice rendering choices out there. The range goes from free - like Aqsis, Blender or Yafray - to bundled renderers that come with the 3D package of choice - Maya software renderer or Lightwave come to mind - to seperate high-end renderers - like MentalRay (although that comes bundled with a lot of big players nowadays) or Renderman. Which one to choose? And which one is actually affordable? That is indeed a tough question. The guys at ZAON studios have [a nice overview of what makes a renderer good] <a href="http://www.zaon.com/company/articles/3d_rendering.php">1</a>. It is all about what the renderer is supposed to be used for. Nothing more nothing less.</p>
<p>In the case of Fridthjof Film, we need a renderer that is able to be as fast as possible, while doing a great job with fine detail. Flickering is one of the major issues we deal with. As we are working with Maya, MentalRay seems to be the logical choice, but it is damn slow when it comes to make fine details really smooth. MentalRay doesn‚Äôt allow to adjust the pixel sampling independent from the sampling of shaders, which makes us increase overall render time when we only needed to increase the render time of one parameter - and that in the long run increases the render times into unacceptable regions. Sad but true.</p>
<p>Now Renderman seems to do the trick, which I already new from the start (being pro-Renderman for quite some time now). The crux with that is, that there is not really a good bridge to Renderman for small companies that cannot afford to program their own. Sure there are free Renderman renderers, but what good are they if I only have an interface only I can use (as the other 3D guys are not as technically oriented). Even [3DeLight] <a href="http://www.3delight.com/">2</a> which has a [nice interface recently] <a href="http://forums.cgsociety.org/showpost.php?p=3259835&amp;postcount=1">3</a> is not up to par in integration with Pixars newest coup - [Pixar‚Äôs Renderman for Maya] <a href="https://renderman.pixar.com/products/tools/rfm_webinfopage.html">4</a>.</p>
<p>Renderman for Maya seems like the ideal option for a small studio like F-Film, where we are three guys right now ‚Äî and only one (me) with previous Renderman experience. It might miss some nice features like RIB im- and export, but that is something I could live with, because the prime feature is usability by non-technical 3D artists.</p>
<p>But then again, a license for Pixars Maya plugin is not exactly cheap with $995,- per license. A major block on the road to bring this baby to the company - at least as far as my boss is concerned. I need to set up a test case (at least one) to show him the advantages and show him that they outweigh by far the disadvantages. Well, I guess there I have my next step.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week we spoke about naming conventions, which got inspired by a topic covered on [Lifehacker] <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/file-management/ask-the-readers-filing-naming-conventions-210104.php">1</a> and [43 Folders] <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/10/23/file-naming/">2</a>. A great start to a more streamlined workflow. But what good is a great filename, when you are unable to find your files in the chaotic folder structure you might have?</p>
<p>For exactly this reason we will talk about how to get an optimized folder structure for multi-media projects. I will obviously have a bias to look at it from a compositors/3D guys/VFX supervisors view, but I am also able to accommodate you editors and other departments.</p>
<p>What we will end up with is an understanding of what is important in a file and folder structure, so you are able to easily adjust the two templates, that we will discuss, to your needs.</p>
<p>###Template No.1 - General purpose environment</p>
<p>This template is geared to a more editing heavy workflow as it seems to be the case in most small TV commercial shops. It also has its room for 3D and compositing, but those are mere means to pimp the editing.</p>
<p>As the main structure we divide into:</p>
<ul>
<li>scene files</li>
<li>materials</li>
<li>sound</li>
<li>output</li>
<li>provals</li>
<li>scratch</li>
<li>temp</li>
</ul>
<p>####Scene files</p>
<p>Obviously all the saved scenes from the involved programs ‚Äî like FinalCut, Maya, shake or AfterEffects ‚Äî go in here into their own subfolder. Now these may vary depending on your tools, but at them moment our scene files substructure looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>FinalCut</li>
<li>DVD</li>
<li>Maya</li>
<li>Shake</li>
<li>Combustion</li>
<li>Compressor</li>
<li>Other</li>
<li>Temp</li>
</ul>
<p>As you notice there is a temp folder just like in the main structure. These are supposed to be the brainstorm areas of the folder structure. Everything that goes in here is just dabbling and will not be backed up and the Temp folders will be deleted at the end of the project.</p>
<p>Now depending on the tool you might want or need to go deeper with your folders. For example, Maya has its own project structure. You could use the default one in the above Maya directory or you could adjust it, so it takes advantage of the folder template we are just creating ‚Äî which would be a wise choice, because you don‚Äôt want to have several folders with the same meaning hanging around.</p>
<p>####Materials</p>
<p>Materials is everything coming in from the outside world. Graphics from the client, video clips, sound bytes, word documents and storyboards. All that goes in here.</p>
<p>Again depending on your individual needs you may subdivide further into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphics</li>
<li>Documents</li>
<li>Fonts</li>
<li>Subtitles</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Temp</li>
</ul>
<p>Should be pretty clear what to use when, right?</p>
<p>####Sound</p>
<p>On most projects there will be sound involved. Music, sound effects, maybe speak. All that goes in here. Again within its own folder, like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final Mix</li>
<li>Speak</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Sound Effects</li>
<li>DVD soundfiles</li>
<li>Temp</li>
</ul>
<p>####Output</p>
<p>Now this is our catchall folder for renderings. We render uncompressed material for archiving. We also render back and forth from editing to VFX. The DVD department needs to receive files, etc.</p>
<p>A folder structure like this looks reasonable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncompressed</li>
<li>-&gt;VFX</li>
<li>&lt;-VFX</li>
<li>DVD</li>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Temp</li>
</ul>
<p>The first folder catches all the uncompressed output from editing. -&gt;VFX is all the stuff that goes into the VFX department and needs 3D or compositing effects applied. The VFX department then renders back to editing (&lt;-VFX) the finished effects.</p>
<p>What the VFX department does when it has to render intermediate files you ask? That is a very good question. There are two ways to handle this in my opinion.</p>
<p>The correct way would be to render all the layers and pre-comps into Output/-&gt;VFX because it is something that goes again into the VFX land. I also tend to create a 3Drenders and a 2Drenders folder, so I can split up the sub-folders and files. Otherwise it might get a bit too crowded.</p>
<p>The lazy way would be to stay in the &lt;-VFX folder. That has the advantage of staying in one folder all the time. Which means human error can be minimized. It happens all too easily that you accidentally render in the wrong VFX folder. And if you have to switch between the two folder (-&gt;VFX and &lt;-VFX) all the time, then it might happen quite easily.</p>
<p>DVD is obviously the folder where all the DVD files belong. All the m2v and m2a and vob‚Äôs and whatnot files only the DVD department can make use of.</p>
<p>-&gt;Sound catches all the files that go to the sound editing as reference files.</p>
<p>And Temp is the same as in all the other locations.</p>
<p>####Approvals</p>
<p>This is just a simple folder where all the files the customer needs to approve are saved. Preview clips and such.</p>
<p>####Scratch</p>
<p>This folder is similar to temp, but has a special meaning for the FinalCup folks. It is the folder where FinalCut renders all the internal caching and pre-render files.</p>
<p>####Temp</p>
<p>I said enough about the meaning of the Temp directories in the other paragraphs I think. As the name implies, the Temp folders are there for dabbling and trying things out. It will not be backed up and it also will be deleted at the end of the project.</p>
<p>It is a sandbox, a playground to try things out.</p>
<p>####That‚Äôs all folks</p>
<p>That was a rundown on a basic production ready file and folder structure. Combine it with the naming convention I showed you and you have a nearly bullet proof system for all the basic needs of a production.</p>
<p>And of course don‚Äôt be shy to adjust this template to your needs. This system lives from its ability to blend into the working environment. The idea is to make handling files in a project easy and fast, while minimizing the potential sources of human error.</p>
<p>This is by no means the ultimate word on folder structures and if you have improvements to the above, I am all ears.</p>

			 <p>[Keith Lango] <a href="http://keithlango.com/">1</a> has an interesting article on his blog concerning [CG pictures/movies and how they have become boring] <a href="http://www.keithlango.com/wordpress/?p=143">2</a>. Keith is of the opinion that the CG look has kind of worn of. We no longer have the ‚Äúwow‚Äù moments when watching a nice full CG movie. And I must say I know what he means.</p>
<p>Nowadays every guy in the backrow knows about 3D and VFX and that it isn‚Äôt a secret art. And that kind of pisses me off. I liked to do magic with pictures. I love the expression on the faces of people watching my (or any cool stuff for that matter) and be completely blown away by the uniqueness or pure beauty of effects. Maybe I am a nerd, but it was fun.</p>
<p>Today all we do is making stuff realistic. Yeah! Bring it on! Let‚Äôs do stuff like we see it every day without CG!</p>
<p>I have only one word for that: <strong>boring</strong></p>
<p>I really am fed up with someone coming to me saying: ‚ÄúHey can you do a magazine or CD or whatever object floating in an undefined space doing normal stuff (like opening and closing)? ‚Ä¶oh and by the way, can you make it as realistic as possible?‚Äù</p>
<p>It is kind of frustrating to work within bounds of one world, when all the candy is in the other world - the CG world - where we can do stuff that is unrealistic and exaggerated.</p>
<p>Or is it just me and Keith?</p>
<p>###Following are the comments from the old blog</p>
<blockquote>
<p>stickman Says:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, count me in. NPR has long been neglected, with endless raytracing programs on the market yet hardly any true NPR renderers. Hard to believe, for two reasons:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Look. A stylistically relevant yet unique look draws an audience. Madagascar shows the potential. So do most all the coffee-table art books of ‚Äúboring3D‚Äù films where the artistic development looks SO much better than the final version.</li>
<li>Efficiency. The last 10% of finalizing a Pixar-look film can comprise 90% of the effort - just think of hair groomers, particle specialists, geometry doctors. NPR looks are much more forgiving in this last phase and can allow for quicker finaling without compromising the visual impact.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short: we need releases of software like ‚ÄúJOT‚Äù. For indy film-makers, students and even the big studios.</p>
