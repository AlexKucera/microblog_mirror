			 <p>Watching Pirates of the Caribbean with the kids (again). It is really amazing how it turned out, considering how the original script had almost no jokes and a very bland Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp really did something wonderful here. 📽</p>

			 <p>After years of online hiatus I have decided to make Micro.Blog my main site. Of course, it is not as simple as it sounds. For example, none of my already existsing posts show on the homepage (<a href="https://alexkucera.micro.blog">https://alexkucera.micro.blog</a>). Also I have issues with pointing my domain (alexanderkucera.com) to my Micro.blog page. But I am slowly chipping away at my issues. I am sure I will prevail. Eventually…</p>

			 <p>Ok. Let’s see. I’ll be trying out posting to Micro.blog directly again for a while. Usually I post to my Kirby blog, but my workflow for that is just a bit convoluted. It might be nice to have a more immediate workflow for a change.</p>

			 <p>Now that micro.blog is live I guess I need to get my Kirby site in order. The hosted version @Manton provides is nice, but ideally I&rsquo;d like to run this via my own site. Man. There simply isn&rsquo;t enough day in a day for all my goals.</p>
