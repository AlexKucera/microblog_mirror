&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I am in Lyon, France to write about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cartoon-media.be/MOVIE/index.php&#34;&gt;Cartoon Movie 2009&lt;/a&gt;. At this conference, motion picture and games are presented to investors and distributors. A wide range of animation styles and storylines is present, which makes the conference really interesting to watch. A lot of great and creative people come together to give each other feedback and to look for new ideas and opportunities. All in all it is an exciting melting pot of like-minded people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be writing a two-page article about it for Professional Production magazine in Germany and probably will present an abridged version of it here when I am done with it. So keep watching this space for more info.&lt;/p&gt;
