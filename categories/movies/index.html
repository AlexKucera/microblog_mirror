         	<p>My son (12 years) has watched me do VFX work from home for half his life - drawing roto shapes, keying green screens, etc. Yet he still has no real grasp of what&rsquo;s involved.</p>

         	<p>Off to see Fantastic Four. I havenâ€™t seen or read any reviews yet. Only watched the trailer and that looked very promising. I hope it is good.</p>
