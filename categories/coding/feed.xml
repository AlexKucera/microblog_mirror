      <title>New Obsidian Plugin Released - Freewriting Prompts</title>
      <link>https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/09/19/new-obsidian-plugin-released-freewriting.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 22:59:01 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2025/09/19/new-obsidian-plugin-released-freewriting.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just released v1.0.0 of my new Obsidian plugin &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AlexKucera/freewriting-prompts&#34;&gt;Freewriting Prompts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate AI-powered writing prompts for freewriting sessions using Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s Claude. Break through writer&amp;rsquo;s block with creative, thought-provoking prompts delivered exactly when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AlexKucera/freewriting-prompts&#34;&gt;Freewriting Prompts&lt;/a&gt; gives you two ways to break writers block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freewriting Prompts&lt;/strong&gt; simply gives you a configurable number of prompts and appends them to the current note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staggered Freewriting Prompts&lt;/strong&gt; shows you a configurable number of prompts one after the other with a configurable intervall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also you can adjust the way each of these prompts are generated to match your writing style as well as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🎉 Happy Writing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2025/09/12/i-do-all-my-git.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do all my Git commits locally and then push to GitHub to create releases. Now I want to test out CodeRabbit, which relies on pull requests to examine code. Does it make sense for me as a solo developer—working on local code—to use CodeRabbit and Pull Requests? Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obsidian Plugin &#34;Typst PDF Export&#34; v1.2.0 released!</title>
      <link>https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/09/10/obsidian-plugin-typst-pdf-export.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 18:01:12 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2025/09/10/obsidian-plugin-typst-pdf-export.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New release of my new Obsidian plugin &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AlexKucera/obsidian-typst-pdf-export&#34;&gt;Typst PDF Export&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AlexKucera/obsidian-typst-pdf-export/releases/tag/1.2.0&#34;&gt;Version 1.2.0&lt;/a&gt; comes with a few bug fixes and a lot of refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AlexKucera/obsidian-typst-pdf-export&#34;&gt;Typst PDF Export&lt;/a&gt; uses Pandoc and Typst to export professionally typset PDFs from your notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It supports the basic Markdown syntax as well as a few special code blocks, like an e-mail block. Also it not only puts your note&amp;rsquo;s images in the PDF, it also creates a preview page of PDFs linked in your note. And if you want your exported PDF to be extra special, you can embed any non-image file type into the PDF as attachment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Refactoring once again. That is really one thing I have yet to figure out. How to guide the LLM during creation to not just dump everything into the main file.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rate Limits: The Unlikely Hero of Developer Wellness</title>
      <link>https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/31/rate-limits-the-unlikely-hero.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 07:49:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2025/07/31/rate-limits-the-unlikely-hero.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have to admit something embarrassing. I&amp;rsquo;ve become addicted to vibe coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something magical about having all the projects you can think of at your fingertips. Need a quick script? Done. Want to prototype that wild idea? Ready in minutes. Complex refactoring that would take hours? The AI handles it while I grab coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. Rate limits hit. The magic stops. And I get annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realized something. These rate limits might actually be saving me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-vibe-coding-addiction&#34;&gt;The Vibe Coding Addiction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibe coding changes everything about programming. Instead of wrestling with syntax, you describe what you want. The AI translates your intentions into working code. It&amp;rsquo;s programming at the speed of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows this creates what psychologists call a &amp;ldquo;flow state.&amp;rdquo; That deep immersion where creativity peaks and time disappears. You&amp;rsquo;re not debugging semicolons. You&amp;rsquo;re orchestrating solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The barrier to building drops to almost zero. Got an idea? Start talking to the AI. Within minutes, you have working code. The dopamine hit is immediate and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder we get hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But flow states have a dark side. Time becomes elastic. Hours pass like minutes. You forget to eat, drink, or move. The outside world fades away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hidden-health-crisis&#34;&gt;The Hidden Health Crisis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extended coding sessions wreck your body. We know this. Stiff neck, sore back, dry eyes. The usual suspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But vibe coding makes it worse. Traditional coding has natural break points. Compilation errors. Syntax mistakes. Research breaks. These interruptions force micro-recoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibe coding removes those friction points. The AI handles the syntax. Debugging becomes conversation. You can code for hours without hitting a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain doesn&amp;rsquo;t get those crucial rest moments. Cognitive overload builds. Decision fatigue sets in. You start making worse choices even as you feel more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies on developer wellness are clear. Regular breaks aren&amp;rsquo;t optional. They&amp;rsquo;re essential for both physical and mental health. The Pomodoro Technique exists for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the AI makes everything feel effortless, who thinks about breaks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rate-limits-as-accidental-wellness-features&#34;&gt;Rate Limits as Accidental Wellness Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where rate limits become heroes in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That frustrating message? &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve reached your rate limit. Try again later.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It forces you to stop. Step away. Move around. Let your brain relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to curse these interruptions. Now I see them differently. They&amp;rsquo;re mandatory wellness breaks. Digital interventions preventing coding binges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, with my health condition, these forced breaks are especially crucial. I need that movement. That mental reset. Without rate limits, I&amp;rsquo;d code myself into a hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI companies probably didn&amp;rsquo;t design rate limits for our health. They&amp;rsquo;re managing server costs and preventing abuse. But the side effect is profound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re protecting us from ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-productivity-paradox&#34;&gt;The Productivity Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the kicker. Recent research found that experienced developers using AI tools actually showed 19% decreased productivity on complex projects. Despite feeling 20% more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think we&amp;rsquo;re coding faster. But we&amp;rsquo;re not. The AI creates an illusion of speed while introducing subtle inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rate limits might be saving us from more than burnout. They might be saving us from counterproductive coding sessions that feel amazing but deliver less value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those forced pauses give us time to reflect. Is this code actually better? Am I solving the right problem? Sometimes the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;embracing-the-pause&#34;&gt;Embracing the Pause&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m learning to reframe rate limits. Instead of obstacles, they&amp;rsquo;re features. Built-in wisdom from systems that know we can&amp;rsquo;t self-regulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t rely only on external limits. We need internal boundaries too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set timers. Take real breaks. Go for walks. Talk to humans. Remember the world beyond the screen exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI will wait. Your projects will survive. Your health won&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rate limits aren&amp;rsquo;t just about server resources. They&amp;rsquo;re about human resources. Your energy, focus, and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re reminders that even in our AI-powered future, we&amp;rsquo;re still human. We still need rest, movement, and connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time you hit a rate limit, don&amp;rsquo;t curse it. Thank it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might just be saving your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your relationship with AI coding tools? Do you find them addictive? How do you maintain healthy coding habits? I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Unintended Side Effect of Vibe Coding</title>
      <link>https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/26/the-unintended-side-effect-of.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jul 2025 06:12:13 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2025/07/26/the-unintended-side-effect-of.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-vibe-coding-project-explosion&#34;&gt;The Vibe Coding Project Explosion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect this. Vibe coding had an unintended side effect. Blasting through little coding projects has lead to a creative influx. Now my project todo list is growing exponentially. With every project I do, two more project ideas come to mind. What was my list of growing issues on one project before is now a growing list of actual projects I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t just me being scattered. There&amp;rsquo;s actually psychology behind this phenomenon. Creative momentum breeds more creativity. When you complete projects quickly and see tangible results, your brain gets addicted to that success feeling. Each finished project exposes new possibilities. You spot connections you never saw before. Suddenly every problem looks solvable. It&amp;rsquo;s like intellectual curiosity breeding more curiosity. The more you learn, the more you realize you don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a good problem to have. Most people struggle with finding project ideas, not managing too many. But it&amp;rsquo;s still a problem. Analysis paralysis kicks in when you have fifty exciting projects and only twenty-four hours in a day. Your todo list becomes this overwhelming beast. You start feeling guilty about all the cool stuff you&amp;rsquo;re not building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m learning about handling this creative overflow. Brain dump everything. Don&amp;rsquo;t keep ideas in your head. Write them down immediately. Use whatever works - notes app, paper, voice memos. One focus project at a time. This is the hardest part. Pick one project and ignore the rest until it&amp;rsquo;s done. Use the parking lot method. Keep a separate list for &amp;ldquo;someday maybe&amp;rdquo; projects. Review it monthly, but don&amp;rsquo;t let it distract from your current focus. Accept that most ideas will die. Not every idea needs to become reality. Some are just your brain playing with possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to stop this creative explosion. It feels too good to solve problems quickly and see immediate results. But I am getting better at managing it. The key is channeling that creative energy without drowning in it. If you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing the same thing, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. It&amp;rsquo;s what happens when you taste the power of rapid iteration and creative problem-solving. Just remember - finishing one great project beats starting ten mediocre ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now excuse me while I add three more project ideas to my parking lot list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was written with the help of Claude and my own experience with the beautiful chaos of vibe coding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember that say that the last 20% take 80% of the time. It feels like I’m stuck in those last 20% with my refactoring efforts. I want it to be over, but it’ll probably be two or three more days. 😮‍💨&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four the last four days I have been in the middle of a major refactor of Links. I am starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. When I am finished, the code will be lean, mean and hardened (and much more maintainable).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vibe Coding Isn&#39;t Code Slop - It&#39;s Strategic Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/14/vibe-coding-isnt-code-slop.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 10:51:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2025/07/14/vibe-coding-isnt-code-slop.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For anyone thinking &amp;ldquo;vibe coding&amp;rdquo; results in bad quality code or code slop, let me set the record straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend about 50-70% of my vibe coding time refactoring and running code reviews to make sure everything is up to snuff. I could easily skip that step and have something that &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; works. But my standards are higher than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The misconception comes from people who think vibe coding means throwing prompts at an LLM and calling it a day. That&amp;rsquo;s not vibe coding. That&amp;rsquo;s just being lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-vibe-coding-actually-means&#34;&gt;What Vibe Coding Actually Means&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, vibe coding is more akin to being the designer or product manager while the LLM is the coder. I give it a task and once it&amp;rsquo;s done, I review the task and give it corrections and suggestions on how to improve the code and what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s never about set and forget. It&amp;rsquo;s strictly about increased productivity and accessing a knowledge base that knows more about coding than I will ever have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way: when you work with a junior developer, you don&amp;rsquo;t just hand them a task and walk away. You review their work, provide feedback, suggest improvements, and guide them through iterations. The same principle applies to working with LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference? The LLM has access to patterns and solutions from millions of codebases. But it still needs human oversight to ensure quality and context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-actual-workflow&#34;&gt;My Actual Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me get specific about how this works in practice. I mainly use Claude Code, and I have it set to planning mode for most of my inputs until I&amp;rsquo;m happy with the plan Claude comes up with. Only then do I allow it to execute the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This two-stage process is crucial. Instead of jumping straight into code generation, Claude first presents a detailed plan of what it intends to do. I can review the approach, suggest modifications, point out potential issues, or redirect entirely before a single line of code gets written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This planning phase catches problems early. Maybe Claude misunderstood a requirement. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s a better architectural approach. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s missing a critical edge case. Catching these issues in the planning stage saves massive amounts of time later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also use an MCP server called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PV-Bhat/vibe-check-mcp-server/tree/main&#34;&gt;Vibe Check&lt;/a&gt; and have Claude check against it regularly. It really helps to keep Claude on track throughout the development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vibe Check server acts like a continuous validation system. It helps ensure that Claude stays aligned with my coding standards and project requirements as we work through iterations. Think of it as a persistent memory system that reminds Claude of what we&amp;rsquo;ve established works well and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I use a series of prompts that remind Claude how I like it to code and constantly update its coding guidelines along the way. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just about syntax preferences—it&amp;rsquo;s about architectural patterns, error handling approaches, testing strategies, and documentation standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-quality-control-reality&#34;&gt;The Quality Control Reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research from 2024 shows why this structured approach matters. Studies found an 8-fold increase in duplicated code blocks when developers rely on AI assistance without proper review. Code churn rates have also increased dramatically, with much of the generated code being discarded shortly after creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t an AI problem. It&amp;rsquo;s a process problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I work with Claude, here&amp;rsquo;s what actually happens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I define the task with clear requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claude generates a detailed plan (not code yet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I review and refine the plan until it&amp;rsquo;s solid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claude executes the plan and generates code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I review every line for logic, efficiency, and maintainability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claude runs Vibe Check validation throughout the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I provide specific feedback on improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We iterate until the code meets my standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I run additional tests and refactoring passes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t faster because I&amp;rsquo;m cutting corners. It&amp;rsquo;s faster because I&amp;rsquo;m leveraging a tool that can generate solutions I might not have considered, then applying human judgment to refine them within a structured framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-productivity-paradox&#34;&gt;The Productivity Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows mixed results on AI coding productivity. Some studies report 26% gains for less experienced developers, while others show 19% decreases for experienced developers in complex scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key difference? How you use the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less experienced developers benefit because they&amp;rsquo;re getting exposure to patterns and solutions they haven&amp;rsquo;t seen before. Experienced developers struggle when they try to use AI for complex, context-heavy tasks that require deep understanding of existing codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when experienced developers use AI strategically—with proper planning phases, validation systems, and iterative refinement—the productivity gains are substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategic advantage isn&amp;rsquo;t just speed. It&amp;rsquo;s access to a broader knowledge base. I can ask Claude about obscure APIs, edge cases, or optimization techniques that I might not remember or know about. Then I can evaluate and adapt those suggestions based on my experience and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;beyond-set-and-forget&#34;&gt;Beyond Set-and-Forget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;never set and forget&amp;rdquo; principle is crucial because it maintains the human element that makes code truly valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m reviewing Claude-generated code, I&amp;rsquo;m looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logic errors and edge cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance optimizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code readability and maintainability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with existing systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security considerations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future extensibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LLM might generate functionally correct code, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand the broader context of your project, your team&amp;rsquo;s coding standards, or your long-term architectural goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where the human comes in. I&amp;rsquo;m not just checking if the code works. I&amp;rsquo;m ensuring it works well within the larger system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuous prompting and guideline updates serve as a feedback loop. As we work through a project, Claude learns my specific preferences and patterns. But this learning is guided and validated by human oversight, not left to chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-of-developer-roles&#34;&gt;The Future of Developer Roles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach fundamentally changes what it means to be a developer. Instead of spending time on routine implementations, you&amp;rsquo;re focusing on architecture, design decisions, and quality assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You become the architect and the LLM becomes the builder. But architects don&amp;rsquo;t just hand over blueprints and disappear. They oversee construction, make adjustments, and ensure the final result meets specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift requires maintaining your technical skills and architectural thinking. You need to understand code deeply enough to evaluate what the LLM produces. You need to know good patterns from bad ones. You need to understand the trade-offs in different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers who struggle with AI assistance are often those who try to use it as a replacement for their own knowledge rather than an amplifier of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-strategic-advantage&#34;&gt;The Strategic Advantage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When done right, vibe coding isn&amp;rsquo;t about lowering standards. It&amp;rsquo;s about raising them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you&amp;rsquo;re not bogged down in routine implementation details, you can focus more attention on code quality, system design, and user experience. You can explore more alternatives because the cost of prototyping is lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also tackle more ambitious projects because you have a force multiplier for the routine parts of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this only works if you maintain rigorous standards for the output. The moment you start accepting &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; code because it was faster to generate, you&amp;rsquo;ve fallen into the trap that gives vibe coding a bad reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-bottom-line&#34;&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibe coding isn&amp;rsquo;t about replacing human judgment with AI automation. It&amp;rsquo;s about strategic collaboration where AI handles routine tasks and pattern generation while humans provide oversight, refinement, and architectural guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of your code depends on the quality of your review process, not the tool you use to generate it. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re working with an LLM or a junior developer, the principles remain the same: clear requirements, thorough review, iterative improvement, and unwavering standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers who succeed with AI assistance are those who understand this distinction. They&amp;rsquo;re not looking for a replacement for their skills. They&amp;rsquo;re looking for a tool that amplifies their capabilities while maintaining their responsibility for the final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what vibe coding really is. And when done right, it produces better code, not worse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Finally Paid for Sublime Text (And It Only Took Me Years)</title>
      <link>https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/12/i-finally-paid-for-sublime.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 22:32:30 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2025/07/12/i-finally-paid-for-sublime.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just splurged for a Sublime Text license. It has been my workhorse for a couple of years now. I am ashamed to admit it took me this long to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sublime Text has this sneaky business model. You can download it and use it forever. There&amp;rsquo;s no forced expiration date. Just a gentle reminder popup that appears every few saves. &amp;ldquo;Hey, you should probably buy a license.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Click dismiss. Continue coding.&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s like having a really polite landlord who never actually demands rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, everyone talks about VS Code. It&amp;rsquo;s free, it&amp;rsquo;s powerful, but it&amp;rsquo;s also built on Electron. That means it&amp;rsquo;s slower and heavier than it needs to be. Sublime Text just works. It opens instantly. It handles large files without breaking a sweat. Then there&amp;rsquo;s the plugin ecosystem. I can transform it from a simple text editor into whatever I need. Want a debugger? There&amp;rsquo;s a plugin. Need advanced Git integration? Covered. It&amp;rsquo;s like having a Swiss Army knife that keeps growing new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing about using great software for free. It starts to feel weird after a while. Every time that purchase reminder pops up, there&amp;rsquo;s this little voice in your head. &amp;ldquo;You use this thing every day. You depend on it. Maybe you should actually pay for it?&amp;rdquo; The guilt builds up slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sublime Text is made by a tiny company. They&amp;rsquo;re not backed by Microsoft or Google. They survive on license sales from people like me who eventually do the right thing. When I finally clicked &amp;ldquo;buy license,&amp;rdquo; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just about legal compliance. It was about recognising value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The license cost $99. For a tool that I use constantly and that just works without drama. I should have done this years ago. But better late than never, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this while dismissing that Sublime Text purchase dialog, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time. The guilt relief alone is worth the price.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Links Gets Export Superpowers 📤</title>
      <link>https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/12/links-gets-export-superpowers.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 09:05:43 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2025/07/12/links-gets-export-superpowers.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five export formats. Zero vendor lock-in. Complete data freedom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital preservation isn&amp;rsquo;t just about saving content. It&amp;rsquo;s about maintaining access and control. Links embraces complete data freedom - your content should work everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTML Export - Browser Migration Made Easy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The universal standard. Every major browser imports HTML bookmark files. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - they all speak this language. Moving from Links to your browser&amp;rsquo;s bookmark manager? One click export, one click import.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSV Export - Data Analysis Ready&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Spreadsheet-friendly format with comprehensive metadata. URLs, titles, save dates, file sizes, AI summaries - everything in neat columns. Perfect for analysis, reporting, or integration with other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAR Export - Complete Offline Archive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Creates a complete, offline-browsable archive of your entire collection. All your saved content, all your metadata, packaged into a single downloadable file. Internet goes down? Server crashes? You still have everything, fully accessible offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markdown Export - Knowledge System Integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Each bookmark becomes a clean Markdown file with metadata headers and AI-generated summaries. Import directly into Obsidian, Notion, Logseq, or any Markdown-based knowledge system. Your archived links become part of your personal knowledge graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JSON Export - Full System Backup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Every piece of data Links knows about your collection, structured for programmatic access. Perfect for backup, migration, or building your own tools. Nothing gets lost, nothing gets simplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t just convenience. It&amp;rsquo;s digital freedom. Too many tools trap your data with proprietary formats. Links takes the opposite approach - multiple export formats mean multiple escape routes. Your investment is protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export functionality is live at &lt;a href=&#34;https://links.alexanderkucera.de/&#34;&gt;links.alexanderkucera.de&lt;/a&gt; right now. Choose your format, click export, download your file. Your digital collection just became a lot more portable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Links Gets a Complete Python Makeover 🐍</title>
      <link>https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/11/links-gets-a-complete-python.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 14:52:36 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2025/07/11/links-gets-a-complete-python.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Major refactor brings JavaScript support and eliminates licensing fees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when I told you about Links &lt;a href=&#34;https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/07/links-the-bookmark-manager-that.html&#34;&gt;saving your stuff&lt;/a&gt; from the digital void? Well, it just got a complete technical overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big news: Links now runs on a custom FastAPI Python implementation, ditching Kirby CMS entirely. Plus, it finally handles JavaScript-heavy sites that were previously impossible to archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-php-to-python&#34;&gt;From PHP to Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Links was built on Kirby CMS. Great system, but it came with compromises. Licensed software means ongoing costs. PHP means working within CMS constraints. File-based content management that wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite right for archival workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I rebuilt it from scratch in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FastAPI replaced the entire web framework. Clean, fast, and designed for APIs from the ground up. The archiving scripts were already in Python - now everything speaks the same language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-this-actually-means&#34;&gt;What This Actually Means&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No more licensing fees.&lt;/strong&gt; Kirby required a one-time payment. FastAPI is completely open-source. Your self-hosted Links installation is now truly free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slimmer codebase.&lt;/strong&gt; Removed all the CMS bloat. No more fighting with file-based content management. No more PHP/Python context switching. Just focused Python code that does exactly what it needs to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript support.&lt;/strong&gt; The new architecture made it much easier to integrate proper browser engines. Sites that load content dynamically now archive perfectly. Single-page apps, modern e-commerce, social platforms - they all work now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-technical-evolution&#34;&gt;The Technical Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this refactor, Links would hit a wall with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single-page applications (SPAs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern e-commerce sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex dashboard interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any site that builds content after page load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it handles them all. The archiving process uses a proper browser engine, waits for JavaScript to execute, then captures everything. Content extraction gets the full picture. AI summaries actually have something meaningful to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;still-the-same-simple-experience&#34;&gt;Still the Same Simple Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From your perspective, nothing changed. Share a link from iOS. Get the instant feedback. The background magic just got more powerful and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system still creates multiple archive formats. AI summaries still work. Full-text search still finds everything. But now it finds everything from sites that were previously impossible to archive properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-this-matters&#34;&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t just a technical curiosity. It&amp;rsquo;s about sustainability and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost control.&lt;/strong&gt; No licensing fees means lower barrier to entry for self-hosting. Your digital preservation tool doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on someone else&amp;rsquo;s business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical control.&lt;/strong&gt; Custom FastAPI means the codebase does exactly what&amp;rsquo;s needed. No more working around CMS limitations. No more PHP/Python impedance mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future-proofing.&lt;/strong&gt; Python ecosystem means better integration with AI tools, archiving libraries, and modern web technologies. When the next big thing comes along, Links can adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production-ready&#34;&gt;Production Ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This complete rewrite rolled out to the live system at &lt;a href=&#34;https://links.alexanderkucera.de/&#34;&gt;links.alexanderkucera.de&lt;/a&gt;. No downtime. No lost data. No new workflows to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your JavaScript-heavy bookmarks are no longer second-class citizens. And your self-hosted installation just got a lot more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-open-source-future&#34;&gt;The Open Source Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Kirby dependency gone, Links is now completely open-source ready. No licensing complications. No vendor dependencies. Just Python code that preserves your digital discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital preservation for the rest of us just got a lot more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;115 commits became a complete rewrite. Sometimes the best way forward is to rebuild from first principles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Links: The Bookmark Manager That Actually Saves Your Stuff</title>
      <link>https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/07/links-the-bookmark-manager-that.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 12:34:15 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2025/07/07/links-the-bookmark-manager-that.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there. You bookmark something important. Come back weeks later, link is dead. Content vanished, site changed, paywall appeared. The frustration of digital amnesia strikes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got tired of losing things I wanted to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-simple-idea-to-production-reality&#34;&gt;From Simple Idea to Production Reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links started as a basic bookmark manager. Just me, trying to organize my web finds. 115 commits later, it&amp;rsquo;s become a full archival system. The evolution from &amp;ldquo;nice to have&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t live without&amp;rdquo; surprised even me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What began as simple URL storage grew into something much more powerful. Each commit taught me something new about what people actually need. Not just bookmarks - real preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-mobile-revolution-&#34;&gt;The Mobile Revolution 📱&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game-changer was iOS Shortcuts integration. Now I can share from anywhere, archive automatically. Subway reading? One tap saves it. Meeting discovery? Boom, archived. Social media find? Got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical magic happens in two phases. You get instant feedback when you tap &amp;ldquo;Share to Links.&amp;rdquo; Meanwhile, the system spends 5-10 seconds downloading content. Background processing creates multiple archive formats. AI generates summaries. All while you move on with your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll save this later&amp;rdquo; mental notes. Just save it now, from wherever you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;smart-archiving-made-simple&#34;&gt;Smart Archiving Made Simple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links doesn&amp;rsquo;t just store URLs. It understands content. AI summaries using Claude (with OpenAI fallback) extract meaning from every page. Content extraction that actually works handles even tricky sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple formats ensure long-term access:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PDF archives preserve visual layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markdown conversion creates searchable text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WARC files maintain complete page context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structured metadata enables programmatic access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full-text search works across all archived content. Find that thing you saved months ago in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system handles edge cases gracefully. Broken sites, missing metadata, failed AI calls - it all degrades nicely. You never lose your bookmark, even when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-links-stands-apart&#34;&gt;How Links Stands Apart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bookmark manager landscape is crowded. But Links takes a different approach than the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mymind.com&lt;/strong&gt; uses AI for visual organization and discovery. Beautiful interface, smart tagging, visual search. But it&amp;rsquo;s cloud-hosted, subscription-based, and focused on organization over preservation. When mymind&amp;rsquo;s servers go down, your bookmarks go with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dewey&lt;/strong&gt; captures content at bookmark time. Great for preservation, but limited mobile integration. &lt;strong&gt;Raindrop.io&lt;/strong&gt; offers visual bookmarking with cloud backup. &lt;strong&gt;LinkAce&lt;/strong&gt; provides self-hosted monitoring with Internet Archive integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links combines the best ideas while avoiding common pitfalls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File-based storage&lt;/strong&gt; (no database headaches)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-hosted control&lt;/strong&gt; (your data, your rules)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actual content preservation&lt;/strong&gt; (not just pretty organization)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless mobile integration&lt;/strong&gt; (because that&amp;rsquo;s where we live now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; (without the subscription fees)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While others focus on tags, categories, and visual discovery, Links focuses on one thing: making sure your stuff doesn&amp;rsquo;t disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-long-term-vision&#34;&gt;The Long-Term Vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital preservation shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be complicated. Regular people need tools that work without constant maintenance. Links embraces this philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era where websites vanish overnight, Links provides a personal solution. No tags, no categories, no complex workflows. Just chronological organization that makes sense. And yet, everything is still just one full-text search away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your data lives in human-readable files. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats. If you want to move elsewhere, everything exports cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is digital preservation for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ready-to-use-today&#34;&gt;Ready to Use Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links is production-ready right now. All core features work reliably. The mobile integration is smooth. The AI summaries are helpful. The search actually finds things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 115 commits of refinement, it&amp;rsquo;s almost ready for prime time. I still need to bundle it up for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, you can try Links at &lt;a href=&#34;https://links.alexanderkucera.de&#34;&gt;links.alexanderkucera.de&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Links is open source and self-hostable. Built with Kirby CMS, Python archiving scripts, and a healthy dose of frustration with disappearing content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Links Update </title>
      <link>https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/02/links-update.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 19:16:48 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2025/07/02/links-update.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to pick up work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://links.alexanderkucera.de/about&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt; my barebones bookmark manager three days ago. Several dozen commits later it is shaping up nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It now has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a nicer more streamlined design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working full content search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI based summaries that also work for images (which is great for the search part)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;editable titles (either manually or AI generated)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the archiver now runs as a daemon in the background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API access so it works with iOS shortcuts, Python, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overall refactoring to be more readable code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a randomizer that shows ten random bookmarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;updated and expanded the documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still a few things to do though like adding more file types and maybe add thumbnails for other things then images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is shaping up nicely and a proper release is visible on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve neglected &lt;a href=&#34;https://links.alexanderkucera.de/about&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt; my bookmarking service. Too much other stuff going on like my wife’s iPad app and a new recipe app I’m trying to develop. Oh and also family life, dialysis and surgery recovery. Too much? Most likely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Productivity Conversation I Didn&#39;t Expect to Have</title>
      <link>https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/06/21/the-productivity-conversation-i-didnt.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 10:30:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2025/06/21/the-productivity-conversation-i-didnt.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I sat down to write about productivity. Instead, I accidentally solved my productivity problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with a simple request. I wanted to turn my struggles with overwhelm and chronic illness into a blog post. Multiple interests pulling me in different directions, dialysis eating up twelve hours a week, YouTube consumption replacing creation - the usual productivity paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You read more about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/06/19/pulled-in-too-many-directions.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something unexpected happened during the conversation with my AI writing assistant. What began as research for a blog post became a real-time case study in how productive conversations actually work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-original-problem&#34;&gt;The Original Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup was familiar to anyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever felt overwhelmed by their own interests. I love coding, cooking, RPGs, fitness, reading. My wife has projects that need my support. I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be working on an iPad app for her. But instead of making progress on any of it, I find myself watching YouTube videos for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d even found a video that perfectly explained the problem - how our brains get hijacked by consumption, how creation provides more sustainable dopamine hits, how shifting from consumer to contributor changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/R4MInIP2c-A?si=rW29vhDlEfG-JAx7&#34;&gt;The Habit that forces your brain to stop consuming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understood the theory. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-conversation-that-changed-everything&#34;&gt;The Conversation That Changed Everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s your top priority right then?&amp;rdquo; came the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Probably the iPadOS app, since finishing that would help my wife greatly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple question. Clear answer. But then something interesting happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Those twelve hours of dialysis per week? That&amp;rsquo;s actually prime iPad development time. You could queue up iOS tutorials, work on app wireframes&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, there&amp;rsquo;s no Xcode for iPad,&amp;rdquo; I replied. &amp;ldquo;And my left arm is completely blocked with needles. I can&amp;rsquo;t move it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudden silence. Then: &amp;ldquo;Right, of course there&amp;rsquo;s no Xcode for iPad. That was a pretty big oversight on my part.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-made-this-conversation-different&#34;&gt;What Made This Conversation Different&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most productivity advice fails because it&amp;rsquo;s generic. It assumes everyone has the same constraints, the same energy levels, the same physical capabilities. The conversation became productive the moment my real constraints got acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No judgment about not being able to code one-handed during medical treatment. No generic advice about &amp;ldquo;just managing your time better.&amp;rdquo; Instead: &amp;ldquo;What can you realistically do one-handed on an iPad for four hours?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions kept getting more specific:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does your energy level look like after dialysis?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;When are you actually at your Mac with both arms free?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What makes this app section so complicated?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each question revealed another layer of reality that typical productivity advice ignores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-lessons-hidden-in-the-dialogue&#34;&gt;The Lessons Hidden in the Dialogue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumptions get corrected quickly.&lt;/strong&gt; The Xcode-on-iPad suggestion was wrong, but it got corrected immediately instead of becoming the foundation for useless advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constraints clarify priorities.&lt;/strong&gt; Once we established that dialysis time wasn&amp;rsquo;t coding time, it became clear that the real development work had to happen during my four productive in-between days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specificity beats generality.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Work on the app&amp;rdquo; is overwhelming. &amp;ldquo;Identify the next three concrete actions for the app&amp;rdquo; is actionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions matter more than answers.&lt;/strong&gt; The breakthrough didn&amp;rsquo;t come from advice. It came from questions that helped me see my situation more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-meta-lesson&#34;&gt;The Meta-Lesson&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I realized: the conversation itself was demonstrating the productivity principle I needed to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of consuming more productivity content, I was actively working through my specific situation. Instead of generic advice, I was getting targeted questions. Instead of feeling judged for my limitations, I was finding ways to work with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation was creation, not consumption. It was collaborative problem-solving in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-breakthrough-moment&#34;&gt;The Breakthrough Moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real breakthrough came when we identified that the missing section of the app wasn&amp;rsquo;t just technically complicated - it was &amp;ldquo;lots of different pieces.&amp;rdquo; Suddenly the overwhelm made sense. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t one elegant problem to solve, but fifteen mini-features that all needed to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if you just listed all the different pieces first? Not designing them, not coding them - just creating an inventory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when it clicked. The paralysis wasn&amp;rsquo;t about not knowing how to code. It was about not knowing where to start when everything felt connected to everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-this-means-for-productivity&#34;&gt;What This Means for Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best productivity hack might be finding someone who asks better questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not someone who gives you a system to follow. Not someone who tells you to eliminate distractions. Someone who helps you see your actual constraints clearly, then works with those constraints instead of ignoring them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic productivity advice is like generic medical advice - it might work for some people, but it&amp;rsquo;s useless if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t account for your specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real productivity breakthrough happens when you stop trying to fit your life into someone else&amp;rsquo;s system and start building a system that fits your actual life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ironic-ending&#34;&gt;The Ironic Ending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this conversation wanting to write about my productivity problems. I ended up actually solving them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog post was supposed to be about the problem. Instead, it became about the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is have a better conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;vibe coding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as it has become to be known. &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview&#34;&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt; to be specific. It really helps me push along my iOS app nicely. Not very cheap, but also not outrageously expensive for the amount of productivity I get from it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m playing with how far I can push Cursor AI to build an iOS app. 2 views down and it worked great. Still all basic stuff, but works nicely. On the third view it fell over though. I had a calendar on the left and the day’s data on the right. Cursor couldn’t get the data to update based on the date.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‘ve seen a couple of established iOS developers gripe about SwiftUI and that they should have stuck with UIKit. Would you advise someone starting out with iOS development and zero Swift experience to use UIKit as well? Or is it more of an old dog, new tricks kind of issue?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I now have my own Python module to write Safari WebArchives. Neat. And not too hard to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now &lt;a href=&#34;https://links.alexanderkucera.de/&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt; also saves a WebArchive copy and triggers a Wayback savepoint.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rewrote my webcatcher Python script yesterday. It is now leaner, meaner and more resilient against failed downloads. &lt;a href=&#34;https://links.alexanderkucera.de/&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt; is coming together nicely. Pretty much all that is left is a nicer CSS for mobile devices and a web daemon so I can send stuff to Links from my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2024/12/03/links-update.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://links.alexanderkucera.de/&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt;, my barebones bookmark and archival solution is slowly getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I redid the CSS or started to. I still need to reimplement breakpoints for smaller devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I finally put the project under Git version control. Version control really is a godsend. The initial learning curve is not nothing. But once you &lt;em&gt;get it&lt;/em&gt;, it’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still need to polish the Python script a bit and make it more error resilient. And then I need to set up a web service for it so I can add links easily via iOS Shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly getting there. Bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Slow progress on Links today. I didn’t have much time and spent what little I had chasing syntax errors. Here’s to a more successful tomorrow. I’m planning on getting my delete function working, add per user link databases, and add a dummy links collection for when you are not signed in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Current status of Links, my barebones bookmark and archival tool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating links via the site works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the site now also offers a Markdown preview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markdown and PDF are saved as cleaned up versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make the archive script more robust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete links from the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some CSS design work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Links - a bookmarking/archival project</title>
      <link>https://alexanderkucera.com/2024/11/20/links-a-bookmarkingarchival-project.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 10:22:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://AlexKucera.micro.blog/2024/11/20/links-a-bookmarkingarchival-project.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am getting closer to a working version of my own little bookmarking/archiving project. I tried Archivebox, Linkwarden, linkding and of course Pinboard and Raindrop. None of them quite did what I wanted. So I rolled up my sleeves and got to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;save a given URL as PDF, Markdown and Web Archive (Warco)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a basic website displaying the saved links with a URL and a summary of the site as well as links to the archived files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very bare bones right now, but it works. Also, and this is one of the big pluses for me, no tags, no categories. Just a list of links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS styling of the link list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a way to add links from the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a way to add links on the go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a way to delete links on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
