        <a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/12/i-finally-paid-for-sublime.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-07-12 22:32:30 &#43;0200">Jul 12, 2025</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I just splurged for a Sublime Text license. It has been my workhorse for a couple of years now. I am ashamed to admit it took me this long to pay for it.</p>
<p>Sublime Text has this sneaky business model. You can download it and use it forever. There&rsquo;s no forced expiration date. Just a gentle reminder popup that appears every few saves. &ldquo;Hey, you should probably buy a license.&rdquo; <em>Click dismiss. Continue coding.</em> It&rsquo;s like having a really polite landlord who never actually demands rent.</p>
<p>In 2025, everyone talks about VS Code. It&rsquo;s free, it&rsquo;s powerful, but it&rsquo;s also built on Electron. That means it&rsquo;s slower and heavier than it needs to be. Sublime Text just works. It opens instantly. It handles large files without breaking a sweat. Then there&rsquo;s the plugin ecosystem. I can transform it from a simple text editor into whatever I need. Want a debugger? There&rsquo;s a plugin. Need advanced Git integration? Covered. It&rsquo;s like having a Swiss Army knife that keeps growing new tools.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing about using great software for free. It starts to feel weird after a while. Every time that purchase reminder pops up, there&rsquo;s this little voice in your head. &ldquo;You use this thing every day. You depend on it. Maybe you should actually pay for it?&rdquo; The guilt builds up slowly.</p>
<p>Sublime Text is made by a tiny company. They&rsquo;re not backed by Microsoft or Google. They survive on license sales from people like me who eventually do the right thing. When I finally clicked &ldquo;buy license,&rdquo; it wasn&rsquo;t just about legal compliance. It was about recognising value.</p>
<p>The license cost $99. For a tool that I use constantly and that just works without drama. I should have done this years ago. But better late than never, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this while dismissing that Sublime Text purchase dialog, maybe it&rsquo;s time. The guilt relief alone is worth the price.</p>

         	<p><em>Five export formats. Zero vendor lock-in. Complete data freedom.</em></p>
<p>Digital preservation isn&rsquo;t just about saving content. It&rsquo;s about maintaining access and control. Links embraces complete data freedom - your content should work everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>HTML Export - Browser Migration Made Easy</strong><br>
The universal standard. Every major browser imports HTML bookmark files. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - they all speak this language. Moving from Links to your browser&rsquo;s bookmark manager? One click export, one click import.</p>
<p><strong>CSV Export - Data Analysis Ready</strong><br>
Spreadsheet-friendly format with comprehensive metadata. URLs, titles, save dates, file sizes, AI summaries - everything in neat columns. Perfect for analysis, reporting, or integration with other tools.</p>
<p><strong>BAR Export - Complete Offline Archive</strong><br>
Creates a complete, offline-browsable archive of your entire collection. All your saved content, all your metadata, packaged into a single downloadable file. Internet goes down? Server crashes? You still have everything, fully accessible offline.</p>
<p><strong>Markdown Export - Knowledge System Integration</strong><br>
Each bookmark becomes a clean Markdown file with metadata headers and AI-generated summaries. Import directly into Obsidian, Notion, Logseq, or any Markdown-based knowledge system. Your archived links become part of your personal knowledge graph.</p>
<p><strong>JSON Export - Full System Backup</strong><br>
Every piece of data Links knows about your collection, structured for programmatic access. Perfect for backup, migration, or building your own tools. Nothing gets lost, nothing gets simplified.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just convenience. It&rsquo;s digital freedom. Too many tools trap your data with proprietary formats. Links takes the opposite approach - multiple export formats mean multiple escape routes. Your investment is protected.</p>
<p>Export functionality is live at <a href="https://links.alexanderkucera.de/">links.alexanderkucera.de</a> right now. Choose your format, click export, download your file. Your digital collection just became a lot more portable.</p>

         	<p><em>Major refactor brings JavaScript support and eliminates licensing fees.</em></p>
<p>Remember when I told you about Links <a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/07/links-the-bookmark-manager-that.html">saving your stuff</a> from the digital void? Well, it just got a complete technical overhaul.</p>
<p>The big news: Links now runs on a custom FastAPI Python implementation, ditching Kirby CMS entirely. Plus, it finally handles JavaScript-heavy sites that were previously impossible to archive.</p>
<h2 id="from-php-to-python">From PHP to Python</h2>
<p>The original Links was built on Kirby CMS. Great system, but it came with compromises. Licensed software means ongoing costs. PHP means working within CMS constraints. File-based content management that wasn&rsquo;t quite right for archival workflows.</p>
<p>So I rebuilt it from scratch in Python.</p>
<p>FastAPI replaced the entire web framework. Clean, fast, and designed for APIs from the ground up. The archiving scripts were already in Python - now everything speaks the same language.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-actually-means">What This Actually Means</h2>
<p><strong>No more licensing fees.</strong> Kirby required a one-time payment. FastAPI is completely open-source. Your self-hosted Links installation is now truly free.</p>
<p><strong>Slimmer codebase.</strong> Removed all the CMS bloat. No more fighting with file-based content management. No more PHP/Python context switching. Just focused Python code that does exactly what it needs to do.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript support.</strong> The new architecture made it much easier to integrate proper browser engines. Sites that load content dynamically now archive perfectly. Single-page apps, modern e-commerce, social platforms - they all work now.</p>
<h2 id="the-technical-evolution">The Technical Evolution</h2>
<p>Before this refactor, Links would hit a wall with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-page applications (SPAs)</li>
<li>Modern e-commerce sites</li>
<li>Social media platforms</li>
<li>Complex dashboard interfaces</li>
<li>Any site that builds content after page load</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it handles them all. The archiving process uses a proper browser engine, waits for JavaScript to execute, then captures everything. Content extraction gets the full picture. AI summaries actually have something meaningful to work with.</p>
<h2 id="still-the-same-simple-experience">Still the Same Simple Experience</h2>
<p>From your perspective, nothing changed. Share a link from iOS. Get the instant feedback. The background magic just got more powerful and more efficient.</p>
<p>The system still creates multiple archive formats. AI summaries still work. Full-text search still finds everything. But now it finds everything from sites that were previously impossible to archive properly.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a technical curiosity. It&rsquo;s about sustainability and control.</p>
<p><strong>Cost control.</strong> No licensing fees means lower barrier to entry for self-hosting. Your digital preservation tool doesn&rsquo;t depend on someone else&rsquo;s business model.</p>
<p><strong>Technical control.</strong> Custom FastAPI means the codebase does exactly what&rsquo;s needed. No more working around CMS limitations. No more PHP/Python impedance mismatch.</p>
<p><strong>Future-proofing.</strong> Python ecosystem means better integration with AI tools, archiving libraries, and modern web technologies. When the next big thing comes along, Links can adapt.</p>
<h2 id="production-ready">Production Ready</h2>
<p>This complete rewrite rolled out to the live system at <a href="https://links.alexanderkucera.de/">links.alexanderkucera.de</a>. No downtime. No lost data. No new workflows to learn.</p>
<p>Your JavaScript-heavy bookmarks are no longer second-class citizens. And your self-hosted installation just got a lot more sustainable.</p>
<h2 id="the-open-source-future">The Open Source Future</h2>
<p>With the Kirby dependency gone, Links is now completely open-source ready. No licensing complications. No vendor dependencies. Just Python code that preserves your digital discoveries.</p>
<p>Digital preservation for the rest of us just got a lot more accessible.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/07/links-the-bookmark-manager-that.html">Links: The Bookmark Manager That Actually Saves Your Stuff</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/07/links-the-bookmark-manager-that.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-07-07 12:34:15 &#43;0200">Jul 7, 2025</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there. You bookmark something important. Come back weeks later, link is dead. Content vanished, site changed, paywall appeared. The frustration of digital amnesia strikes again.</p>
<p>I got tired of losing things I wanted to keep.</p>
<h2 id="from-simple-idea-to-production-reality">From Simple Idea to Production Reality</h2>
<p>Links started as a basic bookmark manager. Just me, trying to organize my web finds. 115 commits later, it&rsquo;s become a full archival system. The evolution from &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; to &ldquo;can&rsquo;t live without&rdquo; surprised even me.</p>
<p>What began as simple URL storage grew into something much more powerful. Each commit taught me something new about what people actually need. Not just bookmarks - real preservation.</p>
<h2 id="the-mobile-revolution-">The Mobile Revolution üì±</h2>
<p>The game-changer was iOS Shortcuts integration. Now I can share from anywhere, archive automatically. Subway reading? One tap saves it. Meeting discovery? Boom, archived. Social media find? Got it.</p>
<p>The technical magic happens in two phases. You get instant feedback when you tap &ldquo;Share to Links.&rdquo; Meanwhile, the system spends 5-10 seconds downloading content. Background processing creates multiple archive formats. AI generates summaries. All while you move on with your day.</p>
<p>No more &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save this later&rdquo; mental notes. Just save it now, from wherever you are.</p>
<h2 id="smart-archiving-made-simple">Smart Archiving Made Simple</h2>
<p>Links doesn&rsquo;t just store URLs. It understands content. AI summaries using Claude (with OpenAI fallback) extract meaning from every page. Content extraction that actually works handles even tricky sites.</p>
<p>Multiple formats ensure long-term access:</p>
<ul>
<li>PDF archives preserve visual layout</li>
<li>Markdown conversion creates searchable text</li>
<li>WARC files maintain complete page context</li>
<li>Structured metadata enables programmatic access</li>
</ul>
<p>Full-text search works across all archived content. Find that thing you saved months ago in seconds.</p>
<p>The system handles edge cases gracefully. Broken sites, missing metadata, failed AI calls - it all degrades nicely. You never lose your bookmark, even when things go wrong.</p>
<h2 id="how-links-stands-apart">How Links Stands Apart</h2>
<p>The bookmark manager landscape is crowded. But Links takes a different approach than the competition.</p>
<p><strong>mymind.com</strong> uses AI for visual organization and discovery. Beautiful interface, smart tagging, visual search. But it&rsquo;s cloud-hosted, subscription-based, and focused on organization over preservation. When mymind&rsquo;s servers go down, your bookmarks go with them.</p>
<p><strong>Dewey</strong> captures content at bookmark time. Great for preservation, but limited mobile integration. <strong>Raindrop.io</strong> offers visual bookmarking with cloud backup. <strong>LinkAce</strong> provides self-hosted monitoring with Internet Archive integration.</p>
<p>Links combines the best ideas while avoiding common pitfalls:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File-based storage</strong> (no database headaches)</li>
<li><strong>Self-hosted control</strong> (your data, your rules)</li>
<li><strong>Actual content preservation</strong> (not just pretty organization)</li>
<li><strong>Seamless mobile integration</strong> (because that&rsquo;s where we live now)</li>
<li><strong>AI intelligence</strong> (without the subscription fees)</li>
</ul>
<p>While others focus on tags, categories, and visual discovery, Links focuses on one thing: making sure your stuff doesn&rsquo;t disappear.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-term-vision">The Long-Term Vision</h2>
<p>Digital preservation shouldn&rsquo;t be complicated. Regular people need tools that work without constant maintenance. Links embraces this philosophy.</p>
<p>In an era where websites vanish overnight, Links provides a personal solution. No tags, no categories, no complex workflows. Just chronological organization that makes sense. And yet, everything is still just one full-text search away.</p>
<p>Your data lives in human-readable files. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats. If you want to move elsewhere, everything exports cleanly.</p>
<p>This is digital preservation for the rest of us.</p>
<h2 id="ready-to-use-today">Ready to Use Today</h2>
<p>Links is production-ready right now. All core features work reliably. The mobile integration is smooth. The AI summaries are helpful. The search actually finds things.</p>
<p>After 115 commits of refinement, it&rsquo;s almost ready for prime time. I still need to bundle it up for distribution.</p>
<p>Until then, you can try Links at <a href="https://links.alexanderkucera.de">links.alexanderkucera.de</a>.</p>

<p><em>Links is open source and self-hostable. Built with Kirby CMS, Python archiving scripts, and a healthy dose of frustration with disappearing content.</em></p>

<p>It now has:</p>
<ul>
<li>a nicer more streamlined design</li>
<li>working full content search</li>
<li>AI based summaries that also work for images (which is great for the search part)</li>
<li>editable titles (either manually or AI generated)</li>
<li>the archiver now runs as a daemon in the background</li>
<li>API access so it works with iOS shortcuts, Python, etc.</li>
<li>overall refactoring to be more readable code</li>
<li>a randomizer that shows ten random bookmarks</li>
<li>updated and expanded the documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Still a few things to do though like adding more file types and maybe add thumbnails for other things then images.</p>
<p>But it is shaping up nicely and a proper release is visible on the horizon.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/06/21/the-productivity-conversation-i-didnt.html">The Productivity Conversation I Didn&#39;t Expect to Have</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/06/21/the-productivity-conversation-i-didnt.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-06-21 10:30:00 &#43;0200">Jun 21, 2025</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I sat down to write about productivity. Instead, I accidentally solved my productivity problem.</p>
<p>It started with a simple request. I wanted to turn my struggles with overwhelm and chronic illness into a blog post. Multiple interests pulling me in different directions, dialysis eating up twelve hours a week, YouTube consumption replacing creation - the usual productivity paradox.</p>
<p>You read more about it <a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/06/19/pulled-in-too-many-directions.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>But something unexpected happened during the conversation with my AI writing assistant. What began as research for a blog post became a real-time case study in how productive conversations actually work.</p>
<h2 id="the-original-problem">The Original Problem</h2>
<p>The setup was familiar to anyone who&rsquo;s ever felt overwhelmed by their own interests. I love coding, cooking, RPGs, fitness, reading. My wife has projects that need my support. I&rsquo;m supposed to be working on an iPad app for her. But instead of making progress on any of it, I find myself watching YouTube videos for hours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d even found a video that perfectly explained the problem - how our brains get hijacked by consumption, how creation provides more sustainable dopamine hits, how shifting from consumer to contributor changes everything.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/R4MInIP2c-A?si=rW29vhDlEfG-JAx7">The Habit that forces your brain to stop consuming</a></p>
<p>I understood the theory. I just couldn&rsquo;t implement it.</p>
<h2 id="the-conversation-that-changed-everything">The Conversation That Changed Everything</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your top priority right then?&rdquo; came the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the iPadOS app, since finishing that would help my wife greatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simple question. Clear answer. But then something interesting happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those twelve hours of dialysis per week? That&rsquo;s actually prime iPad development time. You could queue up iOS tutorials, work on app wireframes&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no Xcode for iPad,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;And my left arm is completely blocked with needles. I can&rsquo;t move it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudden silence. Then: &ldquo;Right, of course there&rsquo;s no Xcode for iPad. That was a pretty big oversight on my part.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="what-made-this-conversation-different">What Made This Conversation Different</h2>
<p>Most productivity advice fails because it&rsquo;s generic. It assumes everyone has the same constraints, the same energy levels, the same physical capabilities. The conversation became productive the moment my real constraints got acknowledged.</p>
<p>No judgment about not being able to code one-handed during medical treatment. No generic advice about &ldquo;just managing your time better.&rdquo; Instead: &ldquo;What can you realistically do one-handed on an iPad for four hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The questions kept getting more specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What does your energy level look like after dialysis?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;When are you actually at your Mac with both arms free?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What makes this app section so complicated?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Each question revealed another layer of reality that typical productivity advice ignores.</p>
<h2 id="the-lessons-hidden-in-the-dialogue">The Lessons Hidden in the Dialogue</h2>
<p><strong>Assumptions get corrected quickly.</strong> The Xcode-on-iPad suggestion was wrong, but it got corrected immediately instead of becoming the foundation for useless advice.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints clarify priorities.</strong> Once we established that dialysis time wasn&rsquo;t coding time, it became clear that the real development work had to happen during my four productive in-between days.</p>
<p><strong>Specificity beats generality.</strong> &ldquo;Work on the app&rdquo; is overwhelming. &ldquo;Identify the next three concrete actions for the app&rdquo; is actionable.</p>
<p><strong>Questions matter more than answers.</strong> The breakthrough didn&rsquo;t come from advice. It came from questions that helped me see my situation more clearly.</p>
<h2 id="the-meta-lesson">The Meta-Lesson</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I realized: the conversation itself was demonstrating the productivity principle I needed to learn.</p>
<p>Instead of consuming more productivity content, I was actively working through my specific situation. Instead of generic advice, I was getting targeted questions. Instead of feeling judged for my limitations, I was finding ways to work with them.</p>
<p>The conversation was creation, not consumption. It was collaborative problem-solving in real time.</p>
<h2 id="the-breakthrough-moment">The Breakthrough Moment</h2>
<p>The real breakthrough came when we identified that the missing section of the app wasn&rsquo;t just technically complicated - it was &ldquo;lots of different pieces.&rdquo; Suddenly the overwhelm made sense. It wasn&rsquo;t one elegant problem to solve, but fifteen mini-features that all needed to connect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if you just listed all the different pieces first? Not designing them, not coding them - just creating an inventory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it clicked. The paralysis wasn&rsquo;t about not knowing how to code. It was about not knowing where to start when everything felt connected to everything else.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-productivity">What This Means for Productivity</h2>
<p>The best productivity hack might be finding someone who asks better questions.</p>
<p>Not someone who gives you a system to follow. Not someone who tells you to eliminate distractions. Someone who helps you see your actual constraints clearly, then works with those constraints instead of ignoring them.</p>
<p>Generic productivity advice is like generic medical advice - it might work for some people, but it&rsquo;s useless if it doesn&rsquo;t account for your specific situation.</p>
<p>The real productivity breakthrough happens when you stop trying to fit your life into someone else&rsquo;s system and start building a system that fits your actual life.</p>
<h2 id="the-ironic-ending">The Ironic Ending</h2>
<p>I started this conversation wanting to write about my productivity problems. I ended up actually solving them.</p>
<p>The blog post was supposed to be about the problem. Instead, it became about the solution.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is have a better conversation.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://links.alexanderkucera.de/">Links</a>, my barebones bookmark and archival solution is slowly getting better.</p>
<p>Today I redid the CSS or started to. I still need to reimplement breakpoints for smaller devices.</p>
<p>Also I finally put the project under Git version control. Version control really is a godsend. The initial learning curve is not nothing. But once you <em>get it</em>, it‚Äôs awesome.</p>
<p>I still need to polish the Python script a bit and make it more error resilient. And then I need to set up a web service for it so I can add links easily via iOS Shortcut.</p>
<p>Slowly getting there. Bit by bit.</p>

         	<p>I am getting closer to a working version of my own little bookmarking/archiving project. I tried Archivebox, Linkwarden, linkding and of course Pinboard and Raindrop. None of them quite did what I wanted. So I rolled up my sleeves and got to work.</p>
<p>Current state:</p>
<ul>
<li>save a given URL as PDF, Markdown and Web Archive (Warco)</li>
<li>a basic website displaying the saved links with a URL and a summary of the site as well as links to the archived files.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very bare bones right now, but it works. Also, and this is one of the big pluses for me, no tags, no categories. Just a list of links.</p>
<p>To be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS styling of the link list</li>
<li>a way to add links from the site</li>
<li>a way to add links on the go</li>
<li>a way to delete links on the site</li>
<li>search</li>
</ul>
