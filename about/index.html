	<h1>About</h1>
	<div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hello everyone. My name is Alexander Kucera and this is my home on the Internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an award-winning 2D/3D generalist and The Foundry certified Nuke trainer who has transitioned from staring at Nuke nodes, shader setups, modo and Maya rigs (and swearing about my own Python scripts) to exploring the fascinating world of artificial intelligence in all its forms.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do-now">What I Do Now</h2>
<p>These days, I work on personal projects that blend technology with practical solutions – developing things like bookmark and archival systems using modern frameworks like FastAPI. I would describe myself less as a creator and more as a solver. Blank pages scare me, so I quickly try to fill them with code and systems that actually work.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not coding, I do occasional remote work for film and TV projects, drawing on my VFX background to solve complex visual problems from the comfort of home.</p>
<h2 id="family-life">Family Life</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate to share my life with my wonderful wife and our two kids. As the resident cook of the household, I&rsquo;ve discovered that tending to my family is just as rewarding as any technical challenge – though the debugging process is quite different when dealing with picky eaters instead of Python scripts.</p>
<h2 id="personal-journey">Personal Journey</h2>
<p>Life has taught me the value of adaptability and resilience. I manage my health with peritoneal dialysis treatments every night – a routine I&rsquo;m genuinely happy to be back to after a temporary switch to hemodialysis. This gentler, more convenient approach fits much better with my lifestyle and, crucially, doesn&rsquo;t interfere with my hammock time. <em>Nothing</em> beats hammock time.</p>
<h2 id="staying-active">Staying Active</h2>
<p>I maintain an active lifestyle through home workouts, including weight lifting and rowing machine sessions. Recently, I&rsquo;ve picked up rucking – it&rsquo;s become a great way to combine fitness with outdoor exploration while building mental toughness, and it&rsquo;s something I can easily fit around family schedules.</p>
<h2 id="technical-philosophy">Technical Philosophy</h2>
<p>I believe in systematic, well-planned approaches to problem-solving. Whether it&rsquo;s achieving 100% test coverage in my projects or investigating legacy code to keep systems clean and efficient, I value concrete, measurable outcomes. I have found that when you write enough code with enough persistence, you occasionally get a whole system that actually works as intended. So stick with me – it may take some time, but we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
<p>Based in Neustadt an der Weinstraße, Germany, I combine the tranquility of wine country with the connectivity of modern technology – a perfect environment for both family life and the constant search for ways to extend my hammock time.</p>
<p>You can find my work history on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1968769/">IMDB</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexkucera">LinkedIn</a>, and there&rsquo;s a rather old showreel on <a href="https://vimeo.com/616994685">Vimeo</a> if you&rsquo;re curious about my VFX days.</p>
