	<h1>About</h1>
	<div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hello everyone. My name is Alexander Kucera and this is my home on the Internet.</p>
<p>I am an award-winning 2D/3D generalist and The Foundry certified Nuke trainer. Furthermore, I used to most often be seen staring at Nuke nodes, shader setups, modo and Maya rigs and swearing about my own Python scripts.</p>
<p>These days I am mostly home-bound due to health reasons, so my focus is mostly on tending to my family as the resident cook and doing the occasional remote work for film and TV projects.</p>
<p>I would describe myself less as a creator and more as a solver. Blank pages scare me, and so I quickly try to fill them with nonsense like this. I have found that when you fill enough pages with enough nonsense, you occasionally get a whole sentence that is actually legible. So stick with me. It may take some time.</p>
<p>I am also constantly searching for ways to extend my hammock time. <em>Nothing</em> beats hammock time.</p>
<p>You can find my work history on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1968769/">IMDB</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexkucera">LinkedIn</a> and I do have a rather old showreel on <a href="https://vimeo.com/616994685">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to get in touch via <a href="mailto:%6D%61%69%6C%74%6F%3A%61%2E%6B%75%63%65%72%61%40%62%61%62%79%6C%6F%6E%64%72%65%61%6D%73%2E%64%65%29">email</a> or on <a href="https://micro.blog/AlexKucera">Micro.blog</a>.</p>
