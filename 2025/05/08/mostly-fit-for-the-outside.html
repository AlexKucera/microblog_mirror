		<p>I am finally out of the hospital! But man, did that place break me down. I felt mostly fit to face the outside again walking around my three short floors. How deluded I was. The only thing that kind of works is walking from the bedroom to the couch. I just went for a walk with my son as safety person. I wanted to see how far I get. The goal was to walk once around the block. I got around the corner (which is right next to our house by the way) and then gave up two houses down. This is still quite a long way to recovery.</p>
