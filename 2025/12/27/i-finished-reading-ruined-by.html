<p>I finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781090532084">Ruined by Design</a> by Mike Monteiro 📚</p>
<p>Good read and Mike raises some very valid points. I just wish his writing wasn’t so repetitive. It feels like 50% of the book could have been edited out.</p>
<p>Maybe he felt like mentioning a point 20-30 times was necessary to hammer it home. 🤷🏼‍♂️</p>
