		<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there. You bookmark something important. Come back weeks later, link is dead. Content vanished, site changed, paywall appeared. The frustration of digital amnesia strikes again.</p>
<p>I got tired of losing things I wanted to keep.</p>
<h2 id="from-simple-idea-to-production-reality">From Simple Idea to Production Reality</h2>
<p>Links started as a basic bookmark manager. Just me, trying to organize my web finds. 115 commits later, it&rsquo;s become a full archival system. The evolution from &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; to &ldquo;can&rsquo;t live without&rdquo; surprised even me.</p>
<p>What began as simple URL storage grew into something much more powerful. Each commit taught me something new about what people actually need. Not just bookmarks - real preservation.</p>
<h2 id="the-mobile-revolution-">The Mobile Revolution ðŸ“±</h2>
<p>The game-changer was iOS Shortcuts integration. Now I can share from anywhere, archive automatically. Subway reading? One tap saves it. Meeting discovery? Boom, archived. Social media find? Got it.</p>
<p>The technical magic happens in two phases. You get instant feedback when you tap &ldquo;Share to Links.&rdquo; Meanwhile, the system spends 5-10 seconds downloading content. Background processing creates multiple archive formats. AI generates summaries. All while you move on with your day.</p>
<p>No more &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save this later&rdquo; mental notes. Just save it now, from wherever you are.</p>
<h2 id="smart-archiving-made-simple">Smart Archiving Made Simple</h2>
<p>Links doesn&rsquo;t just store URLs. It understands content. AI summaries using Claude (with OpenAI fallback) extract meaning from every page. Content extraction that actually works handles even tricky sites.</p>
<p>Multiple formats ensure long-term access:</p>
<ul>
<li>PDF archives preserve visual layout</li>
<li>Markdown conversion creates searchable text</li>
<li>WARC files maintain complete page context</li>
<li>Structured metadata enables programmatic access</li>
</ul>
<p>Full-text search works across all archived content. Find that thing you saved months ago in seconds.</p>
<p>The system handles edge cases gracefully. Broken sites, missing metadata, failed AI calls - it all degrades nicely. You never lose your bookmark, even when things go wrong.</p>
<h2 id="how-links-stands-apart">How Links Stands Apart</h2>
<p>The bookmark manager landscape is crowded. But Links takes a different approach than the competition.</p>
<p><strong>mymind.com</strong> uses AI for visual organization and discovery. Beautiful interface, smart tagging, visual search. But it&rsquo;s cloud-hosted, subscription-based, and focused on organization over preservation. When mymind&rsquo;s servers go down, your bookmarks go with them.</p>
<p><strong>Dewey</strong> captures content at bookmark time. Great for preservation, but limited mobile integration. <strong>Raindrop.io</strong> offers visual bookmarking with cloud backup. <strong>LinkAce</strong> provides self-hosted monitoring with Internet Archive integration.</p>
<p>Links combines the best ideas while avoiding common pitfalls:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File-based storage</strong> (no database headaches)</li>
<li><strong>Self-hosted control</strong> (your data, your rules)</li>
<li><strong>Actual content preservation</strong> (not just pretty organization)</li>
<li><strong>Seamless mobile integration</strong> (because that&rsquo;s where we live now)</li>
<li><strong>AI intelligence</strong> (without the subscription fees)</li>
</ul>
<p>While others focus on tags, categories, and visual discovery, Links focuses on one thing: making sure your stuff doesn&rsquo;t disappear.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-term-vision">The Long-Term Vision</h2>
<p>Digital preservation shouldn&rsquo;t be complicated. Regular people need tools that work without constant maintenance. Links embraces this philosophy.</p>
<p>In an era where websites vanish overnight, Links provides a personal solution. No tags, no categories, no complex workflows. Just chronological organization that makes sense. And yet, everything is still just one full-text search away.</p>
<p>Your data lives in human-readable files. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats. If you want to move elsewhere, everything exports cleanly.</p>
<p>This is digital preservation for the rest of us.</p>
<h2 id="ready-to-use-today">Ready to Use Today</h2>
<p>Links is production-ready right now. All core features work reliably. The mobile integration is smooth. The AI summaries are helpful. The search actually finds things.</p>
<p>After 115 commits of refinement, it&rsquo;s almost ready for prime time. I still need to bundle it up for distribution.</p>
<p>Until then, you can try Links at <a href="https://links.alexanderkucera.de">links.alexanderkucera.de</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Links is open source and self-hostable. Built with Kirby CMS, Python archiving scripts, and a healthy dose of frustration with disappearing content.</em></p>
