		<p><em>Five export formats. Zero vendor lock-in. Complete data freedom.</em></p>
<p>Digital preservation isn&rsquo;t just about saving content. It&rsquo;s about maintaining access and control. Links embraces complete data freedom - your content should work everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>HTML Export - Browser Migration Made Easy</strong><br>
The universal standard. Every major browser imports HTML bookmark files. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - they all speak this language. Moving from Links to your browser&rsquo;s bookmark manager? One click export, one click import.</p>
<p><strong>CSV Export - Data Analysis Ready</strong><br>
Spreadsheet-friendly format with comprehensive metadata. URLs, titles, save dates, file sizes, AI summaries - everything in neat columns. Perfect for analysis, reporting, or integration with other tools.</p>
<p><strong>BAR Export - Complete Offline Archive</strong><br>
Creates a complete, offline-browsable archive of your entire collection. All your saved content, all your metadata, packaged into a single downloadable file. Internet goes down? Server crashes? You still have everything, fully accessible offline.</p>
<p><strong>Markdown Export - Knowledge System Integration</strong><br>
Each bookmark becomes a clean Markdown file with metadata headers and AI-generated summaries. Import directly into Obsidian, Notion, Logseq, or any Markdown-based knowledge system. Your archived links become part of your personal knowledge graph.</p>
<p><strong>JSON Export - Full System Backup</strong><br>
Every piece of data Links knows about your collection, structured for programmatic access. Perfect for backup, migration, or building your own tools. Nothing gets lost, nothing gets simplified.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just convenience. It&rsquo;s digital freedom. Too many tools trap your data with proprietary formats. Links takes the opposite approach - multiple export formats mean multiple escape routes. Your investment is protected.</p>
<p>Export functionality is live at <a href="https://links.alexanderkucera.de/">links.alexanderkucera.de</a> right now. Choose your format, click export, download your file. Your digital collection just became a lot more portable.</p>
