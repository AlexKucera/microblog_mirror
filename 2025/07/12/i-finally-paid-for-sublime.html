		<p>I just splurged for a Sublime Text license. It has been my workhorse for a couple of years now. I am ashamed to admit it took me this long to pay for it.</p>
<p>Sublime Text has this sneaky business model. You can download it and use it forever. There&rsquo;s no forced expiration date. Just a gentle reminder popup that appears every few saves. &ldquo;Hey, you should probably buy a license.&rdquo; <em>Click dismiss. Continue coding.</em> It&rsquo;s like having a really polite landlord who never actually demands rent.</p>
<p>In 2025, everyone talks about VS Code. It&rsquo;s free, it&rsquo;s powerful, but it&rsquo;s also built on Electron. That means it&rsquo;s slower and heavier than it needs to be. Sublime Text just works. It opens instantly. It handles large files without breaking a sweat. Then there&rsquo;s the plugin ecosystem. I can transform it from a simple text editor into whatever I need. Want a debugger? There&rsquo;s a plugin. Need advanced Git integration? Covered. It&rsquo;s like having a Swiss Army knife that keeps growing new tools.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing about using great software for free. It starts to feel weird after a while. Every time that purchase reminder pops up, there&rsquo;s this little voice in your head. &ldquo;You use this thing every day. You depend on it. Maybe you should actually pay for it?&rdquo; The guilt builds up slowly.</p>
<p>Sublime Text is made by a tiny company. They&rsquo;re not backed by Microsoft or Google. They survive on license sales from people like me who eventually do the right thing. When I finally clicked &ldquo;buy license,&rdquo; it wasn&rsquo;t just about legal compliance. It was about recognising value.</p>
<p>The license cost $99. For a tool that I use constantly and that just works without drama. I should have done this years ago. But better late than never, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this while dismissing that Sublime Text purchase dialog, maybe it&rsquo;s time. The guilt relief alone is worth the price.</p>
