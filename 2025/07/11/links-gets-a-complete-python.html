		<p><em>Major refactor brings JavaScript support and eliminates licensing fees.</em></p>
<p>Remember when I told you about Links <a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/2025/07/07/links-the-bookmark-manager-that.html">saving your stuff</a> from the digital void? Well, it just got a complete technical overhaul.</p>
<p>The big news: Links now runs on a custom FastAPI Python implementation, ditching Kirby CMS entirely. Plus, it finally handles JavaScript-heavy sites that were previously impossible to archive.</p>
<h2 id="from-php-to-python">From PHP to Python</h2>
<p>The original Links was built on Kirby CMS. Great system, but it came with compromises. Licensed software means ongoing costs. PHP means working within CMS constraints. File-based content management that wasn&rsquo;t quite right for archival workflows.</p>
<p>So I rebuilt it from scratch in Python.</p>
<p>FastAPI replaced the entire web framework. Clean, fast, and designed for APIs from the ground up. The archiving scripts were already in Python - now everything speaks the same language.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-actually-means">What This Actually Means</h2>
<p><strong>No more licensing fees.</strong> Kirby required a one-time payment. FastAPI is completely open-source. Your self-hosted Links installation is now truly free.</p>
<p><strong>Slimmer codebase.</strong> Removed all the CMS bloat. No more fighting with file-based content management. No more PHP/Python context switching. Just focused Python code that does exactly what it needs to do.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript support.</strong> The new architecture made it much easier to integrate proper browser engines. Sites that load content dynamically now archive perfectly. Single-page apps, modern e-commerce, social platforms - they all work now.</p>
<h2 id="the-technical-evolution">The Technical Evolution</h2>
<p>Before this refactor, Links would hit a wall with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-page applications (SPAs)</li>
<li>Modern e-commerce sites</li>
<li>Social media platforms</li>
<li>Complex dashboard interfaces</li>
<li>Any site that builds content after page load</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it handles them all. The archiving process uses a proper browser engine, waits for JavaScript to execute, then captures everything. Content extraction gets the full picture. AI summaries actually have something meaningful to work with.</p>
<h2 id="still-the-same-simple-experience">Still the Same Simple Experience</h2>
<p>From your perspective, nothing changed. Share a link from iOS. Get the instant feedback. The background magic just got more powerful and more efficient.</p>
<p>The system still creates multiple archive formats. AI summaries still work. Full-text search still finds everything. But now it finds everything from sites that were previously impossible to archive properly.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a technical curiosity. It&rsquo;s about sustainability and control.</p>
<p><strong>Cost control.</strong> No licensing fees means lower barrier to entry for self-hosting. Your digital preservation tool doesn&rsquo;t depend on someone else&rsquo;s business model.</p>
<p><strong>Technical control.</strong> Custom FastAPI means the codebase does exactly what&rsquo;s needed. No more working around CMS limitations. No more PHP/Python impedance mismatch.</p>
<p><strong>Future-proofing.</strong> Python ecosystem means better integration with AI tools, archiving libraries, and modern web technologies. When the next big thing comes along, Links can adapt.</p>
<h2 id="production-ready">Production Ready</h2>
<p>This complete rewrite rolled out to the live system at <a href="https://links.alexanderkucera.de/">links.alexanderkucera.de</a>. No downtime. No lost data. No new workflows to learn.</p>
<p>Your JavaScript-heavy bookmarks are no longer second-class citizens. And your self-hosted installation just got a lot more sustainable.</p>
<h2 id="the-open-source-future">The Open Source Future</h2>
<p>With the Kirby dependency gone, Links is now completely open-source ready. No licensing complications. No vendor dependencies. Just Python code that preserves your digital discoveries.</p>
<p>Digital preservation for the rest of us just got a lot more accessible.</p>
