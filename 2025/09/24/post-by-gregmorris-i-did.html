<p>Luckily, our neck of the woods is still relatively slop free. But then again, I live like a hermit anyways. There is hardly any avenue for slop to enter my life. But even I notice it more and more.
I am an avid user of LLMs. But I see it more as a work partner to bounce ideas off of. Or as a junior that preps stuff for me. The buck always stops with me.</p>
