		<p>People have no idea how much energy and focus it costs to live with chronic pain.</p>
<p>How I need to muster every ounce of focus to not scratch myself all over while I am talking with you. Or how every step hurts and simply walking around the house is so taxing that I want to lie down after a few steps. And then I need to keep up with the energy of my two kids and try to keep smiling for them.</p>
<p>It is exhausting.</p>
<p>But I am not giving up.</p>
