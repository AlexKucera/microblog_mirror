		<p>After my kidney surgery, everything changed. I had to switch from peritoneal dialysis (PD) to hemodialysis (HD). PD is the type where you dialyze at home through your abdomen. HD is what most people picture - sitting in a clinic hooked to a machine.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a choice in this. The surgery made the decision for me.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-miss-most-about-pd">What I Miss Most About PD</h2>
<p>I miss my nights. With PD, I just hooked up before bed. The machine worked while I slept. Eight hours of gentle, continuous cleaning. No alarms, no nurses, no commute.</p>
<p>I could roll over. I could get up for water. I could live.</p>
<p>Now that freedom is gone. PD was like a gentle stream cleaning my blood all night. HD feels like a pressure washer blasting through me. Both work, but one lets you forget you&rsquo;re sick.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-ultrafiltration">Understanding Ultrafiltration</h2>
<p>Let me explain ultrafiltration. It&rsquo;s just a fancy word for removing extra fluid. Your kidneys normally do this when you pee. Dialysis has to do it artificially.</p>
<p>With PD, I could remove about twice as much fluid. The peritoneum - that&rsquo;s your abdominal lining - acts like a filter. Glucose in the dialysis fluid pulls water from your blood. It&rsquo;s osmosis, really.</p>
<p>HD uses pressure instead. It forces fluid out through an artificial membrane. It works, but there&rsquo;s a limit. Push too hard and you cramp. Your blood pressure drops. You feel awful.</p>
<h2 id="the-hd-reality">The HD Reality</h2>
<p>Four hours. That&rsquo;s what HD demands from me. Four hours of complete stillness every two days.</p>
<p>Try lying perfectly still for four hours. Your arm with the needles can&rsquo;t move. One wrong shift and alarms scream. Blood might leak. The nurses rush over.</p>
<p>My back aches after two hours. My legs want to stretch. My mind goes crazy with boredom. I watch the clock like it&rsquo;s my enemy.</p>
<p>Some people sleep through it. I can&rsquo;t. I just lie there, waiting.</p>
<h2 id="what-hd-does-better">What HD Does Better</h2>
<p>I have to be fair here. HD removes phosphate and potassium like a champion. These minerals build up when your kidneys fail. Too much potassium stops your heart. Too much phosphate destroys your bones.</p>
<p>HD clears them efficiently. Three times a week, boom - levels drop. With PD, it was always a struggle. I took binders with every meal. I avoided certain foods.</p>
<p>So yes, HD has its advantages. But at what cost?</p>
<h2 id="the-trade-off-id-make">The Trade-Off I&rsquo;d Make</h2>
<p>Give me back my PD tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll take the phosphate binders. I&rsquo;ll skip the bananas and potatoes. I&rsquo;ll manage the potassium myself.</p>
<p>What good is efficient toxin removal if it steals your life? I&rsquo;d rather have good days with some dietary restrictions. HD gives me perfect labs and exhausting treatment days.</p>
<p>Quality of life matters. Being able to work matters. Traveling without planning around clinics matters. Sleeping in your own bed every night matters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d make that trade in a heartbeat.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>My doctors say I might return to PD eventually. The surgical site needs to heal completely first. I&rsquo;m counting the days.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re choosing between PD and HD, think beyond the medical numbers. Consider your lifestyle. Value your independence. Ask about all your options.</p>
<p>HD works well for many people. Some prefer the structure. Some like not managing their own care. That&rsquo;s valid too.</p>
<p>But for me? I just want my nights back. I want to wake up dialyzed, not exhausted. I want treatment that fits my life, not life that fits my treatment.</p>
<p>Until then, I&rsquo;ll endure my four-hour sessions. I&rsquo;ll appreciate what HD does well. But I&rsquo;ll keep hoping for the day I can go home again.</p>
