		<p>I had my cataract surgery this afternoon and I&rsquo;m not allowed to read or watch anything on TV or my iPad for three days. I&rsquo;m already feeling somewhat at a loss. I&rsquo;m looking for ideas of what to do that won&rsquo;t strain my eyes and also won&rsquo;t strain my body too much, since I cannot lift heavy weights, do sports, or engage in any other strenuous activities that would increase my blood circulation or blood pressure too much.</p>
