		<p>Hi, I gave you a link to this page following a discussion we likely had. Consider this the end of my involvement in whatever topic we were discussing. One of the following likely happened. Please pick the one that seems most appropriate—or if you are so inclined the one that offends you most or least<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The discussion started meandering and I lost interest in discussing this any further.</li>
<li>I just can’t deal with you anymore otherwise my blood pressure is going to kill me. And I don’t want that to happen.</li>
<li>You obviously hold a belief that is too different from mine and the whole discussion is just getting tedious. I have no time for tedious if I can avoid it, which I hereby am.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a fine line between being a squeaky wheel and an annoying troll. Guess which side of the line I think you are on. Hint: I try to make it a habit of not feeding trolls.</li>
<li>I don’t give a fuck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of those sound like they might be it? Great. Consider this discussion over. If you want to you can tell all your friends that you won a discussion on the Internet. Congratulations. Here’s a cookie. Now, can we move on please? Thanks.</p>

<p>If this sounds very boilerplate, it’s because it is. I realised that I don’t feel like spending my life having pointless discussions. Now, what’s pointless to me might be entirely essential to you. But that is besides the point since I am choosing to end this discussion.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
