         	<p>To quote <a href="http://help.micro.blog/2015/why-i-created-this/">Manton Reece</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of you remember the earlier days of the web. If you wanted to write on the internet, you created a web site. You could publish essays, post photos, start weblogs.
…
Today, most writing instead goes into a small number of popular social networking sites.
…
I believe that even these short-form posts, no matter if they seem unimportant and fleeting at the time, still have an important place in the open web. That’s why I created Micro.blog. It focuses on short, recent posts, so I built that idea right into the name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And since I very much am in favor of owning your content my short posts (or snippets) live on my site now. They get syndicated to Twitter and Facebook, but the original content lives right here on my site. There is a separate <a href="http://blog.alexanderkucera.com/microblog/feed">RSS feed</a> for it so it doesn&rsquo;t pollute the main blog feed.</p>

         	<p>Hi, I gave you a link to this page following a discussion we likely had. Consider this the end of my involvement in whatever topic we were discussing. One of the following likely happened.

<li>The discussion started meandering and I lost interest in discussing this any further.</li>
<li>I just can’t deal with you anymore otherwise my blood pressure is going to kill me. And I don’t want that to happen.</li>
<li>You obviously hold a belief that is too different from mine and the whole discussion is just getting tedious. I have no time for tedious if I can avoid it, which I hereby am.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a fine line between being a squeaky wheel and an annoying troll. Guess which side of the line I think you are on. Hint: I try to make it a habit of not feeding trolls.</li>
<li>I don’t give a fuck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of those sound like they might be it? Great. Consider this discussion over. If you want to you can tell all your friends that you won a discussion on the Internet. Congratulations. Here’s a cookie. Now, can we move on please? Thanks.</p>

Only problem is that this is not going to end up in my repo and is being overwritten with the post-receive hook every time I push something to the repo.</p>
<p>Right now I am using this hook:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#!/bin/sh
WEB_DIR=/home/user/public_html/pathtoblog

# remove any untracked files and directories
git --work-tree=${WEB_DIR} clean -fd

# force checkout of the latest deploy
git --work-tree=${WEB_DIR} checkout master --force
</code></pre><p>Is there a way to modify this so it does not clean <code>WEB_DIR</code> but instead commit/merge any changes from <code>WEB_DIR</code> before checkout?</p>

         	<p>A new series on compositing by yours truly just went live on pixelfondue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this new series on compositing we will look at the very basic techniques of compositing. How compositing works under the hood. So if you want to grow your compositing skills beyond simply pressing a bunch of buttons and hope that the result is worthwhile stick around.
I am going to work in Nuke, because it is very well suited for this “under the hood” way of working as it exposes a lot of technical info in its UI already. However, the concepts work the same in any other compositing package like Fusion, After Effects, Photoshop, Blender or Natron. Please refer to your manual for equivalent functions.
If you want to follow along you can download the Nuke Non-Commercial edition.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="http://parfene.com/">Nick Parfene</a> over in the Indie Microblogging Slack asked me to write about my posting workflow and since I haven’t written about how I blog for <a href="http://blog.alexanderkucera.com/articles/blogging_workflow_again">over three years</a> it could do with an update.</p>
<h2 id="why-change">Why change?</h2>
<p>First, why change the previous workflow? I got confused. Simple as that. My blogging schedule is erratic at best. And the old run and gun style workflow, while working, always left me scratching my head when I hadn’t touched it for a few months. I know, months is a sad amount of idle time between posts. But it is what it is.</p>
<p>So to keep myself in the loop what happened to my blog I decided to adopt Git for keeping a publishing history. Not only does it allow me to tinker with the blog’s templates and CSS without messing up, it also serves as a nice automatic history what I did when and for what reason. I just need to read the commit log to job my memory.</p>
<h2 id="the-in-between-workflow">The in-between workflow</h2>
<p>The last workflow I wrote about three years ago relied on a desktop machine running. While I have a server machine running 24/7 I did experience too many hiccups with that approach to feel reliable. So I switched it to a two pronged process that worked pretty well. On the go I was posting with Workflow and Transmit and on the desktop I was using Hazel with a <a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/uploads/2024/blog-post-transform.zip">custom Python script</a>.</p>
<p>This tended to work pretty well. Especially the on the go version. Write stuff in whatever text editor suits you best (I use <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/de/app/ulysses/id950335311?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%253D4">Ulysses</a>), send over to <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?">Workflow</a> for <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/b0364be085534bb8b94003de824f8d4d">processing</a> and upload to blog with <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/transmit-ios/id917432930?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%253D4">Transmit</a>. For images the procedure is similar only I use <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/42d6d670bbd940148a8e3c945682bc15">ImageOptim</a> or <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/a70ddd60f996477385a2d5d2d934fa60">Kraken</a> for image optimization before uploading. I use both at the moment and have not decided which one I like better.</p>
<h2 id="microblog-and-git">Micro.blog and Git</h2>
<p>Now, beginning of this year <a href="http://www.manton.org">Manton Reece</a> created a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing">Kickstarter project</a> about Microblogging (Kickstarter is over, but you can enter your details on a <a href="http://riverfold.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=241a0ce5d267c19de7fcf819f&amp;id=98f8896de4">mailing list</a> if you are interested in it). I found the idea enticing and so I joined the project. This basically got me fired up to tinker with my blog again, which led to the adoption of Git since I couldn’t make heads or tails of whatever my latest changes to it had been.</p>
<p>The idea is really quite simple. Git has the ability to run scripts, so called <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks">Hooks</a>, when certain events happen. In my case I use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/githooks.html">post-receive hook</a> to check out the newest version of my site whenever I push something to my server’s repository. There are a <a href="http://bobbelderbos.com/2012/03/push-code-remote-web-server-git/">number</a> of <a href="http://toroid.org/git-website-howto">guides</a> available, but the one I found most helpful was <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/simple-git-deployment-strategy-for-static-sites/">Nicolas Gallagher’s</a>.</p>
<p>Once that is set up the writing pipeline is really pretty similar to what I had above.</p>
<p>Write stuff in whatever text editor suits you best (I still use <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/de/app/ulysses/id950335311?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%253D4">Ulysses</a>), send over to <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?">Workflow</a> for <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/1eb4469c83b145c8867311bdcb9cd986">processing</a>, which then sends the article to <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-enterprise/id965019520?mt=8">Working Copy</a>, an iOS Git client. In Working Copy I can check and if necessary correct the post or snippet and then commit and push the changes to my Git repository on the server. There is gets immediately checked out to the live site. For images I still use <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/42d6d670bbd940148a8e3c945682bc15">ImageOptim</a> or <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/a70ddd60f996477385a2d5d2d934fa60">Kraken</a>.</p>
<p>The desktop version is almost the same really. I also use <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/de/app/ulysses/id623795237?mt=12&amp;ign-mpt=uo%253D4">Ulysses</a> for my desktop writing. From there I go via a custom <a href="https://alexanderkucera.com/uploads/2024/ulysses-blog-post.zip">Alfred workflow</a> that preps the article and then I push the changes up to my Git repository with <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/mac/">Tower</a>, but I could just as easily fire off a simple <code>git push</code> from Terminal.</p>

         	<p>My new Bluffworks Chinos just arrived and they are a great fit. Very comfortable to wear. The fabric is nicer on the skin then their regular travel pants and they feel a bit warmer as well, which is nice in the winter with temperatures of -10°C. Overall I am a very happy customer if it weren’t for the horrendous import tax and the slow customs processing, none of which is Bluffworks’ fault of course. But €160 after customs for one pair of pants is not cheap to say it mildly. Anyway, I can highly recommend them and the regular travel pants for anyone who wants some good looking pants that are very easy to take care of, pack lightly and work great as travel, business and casual pants.</p>
