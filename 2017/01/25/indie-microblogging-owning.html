		<p>Manton Reece has released his Kickstarter project into the wild. It&rsquo;s his take on what a decentralized micro blogging—or short form posting—might look like.</p>
<p>It looks like he might make his 80k stretch goal.</p>
<p>Please take a few minutes and listen to his pitch. Maybe it&rsquo;s of interest to you. Manton and all us backers would appreciate the help.</p>
