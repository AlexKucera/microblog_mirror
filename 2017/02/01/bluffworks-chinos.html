		<p>My new Bluffworks Chinos just arrived and they are a great fit. Very comfortable to wear. The fabric is nicer on the skin then their regular travel pants and they feel a bit warmer as well, which is nice in the winter with temperatures of -10°C. Overall I am a very happy customer if it weren’t for the horrendous import tax and the slow customs processing, none of which is Bluffworks’ fault of course. But €160 after customs for one pair of pants is not cheap to say it mildly. Anyway, I can highly recommend them and the regular travel pants for anyone who wants some good looking pants that are very easy to take care of, pack lightly and work great as travel, business and casual pants.</p>
