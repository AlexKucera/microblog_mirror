		<p>A new series on compositing by yours truly just went live on pixelfondue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this new series on compositing we will look at the very basic techniques of compositing. How compositing works under the hood. So if you want to grow your compositing skills beyond simply pressing a bunch of buttons and hope that the result is worthwhile stick around.
I am going to work in Nuke, because it is very well suited for this “under the hood” way of working as it exposes a lot of technical info in its UI already. However, the concepts work the same in any other compositing package like Fusion, After Effects, Photoshop, Blender or Natron. Please refer to your manual for equivalent functions.
If you want to follow along you can download the Nuke Non-Commercial edition.</p>
