		<p>I recently took stock of my video tutorial archive and it turns out I have 4,5 months of <a href="http://www.fxphd.com">fxphd</a> videos alone (assuming I watch them eight hours a day and take weekend breaks). Add to that  tons of modo tutorials, Maya, Gnomon, Lynda.com, Digital Tutors, you name it. That is a <strong>lot</strong> of accumulated knowledge. It also was a large enough number that I started to ask myself if I really need this many tutorials or if I am just addicted to collecting as many as possible. I am behind on watching them after all.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about the old saying that one should surround oneself with people more skilled then oneself or smarter or generally just betterâ€”depending on the source of the quote.</p>
<p>I work from home, so while I see the wisdom in these words, actually doing something about it tends to be tricky when you are stuck in your own four walls almost 24/7. But it occurred to me that I <em>am</em> surrounding myself with smarter, more skilled people all the time. They mostly come too me in the form of video tutorials. I get to see a ton of different people showing me their way of tackling problems and offering solutions I would have never thought of. And, true, open time spots to watch them fluctuate wildly depending on project load, but I am also known for watching tutorials for a whole week straight if business is running a bit slow.</p>
<p>I feel like this is a very valuable practice that allows me to not only keep my sanity sitting mostly alone in an office, but also fill my subconsious with tons of input that I am able to make use of at a later date.</p>
