		<p>I’m usually very reserved with being the typical proud obnoxious dad. Mostly, because I find that extremely annoying in other people as well.</p>
<p>That being said, I just had to share this image my son Robin just created in Pixelmator. I helped where he didn’t know which keys to press, but the rest is all him.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I like it. Then again, that’s what parents are supposed to feel, right? :)</p>
