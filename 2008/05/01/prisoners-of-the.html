<p>It is official now. The production of &ldquo;Prisoners of the Sun&rdquo; has been put on hold. All employees and freelancers have been laid of as of 30th April 2008.</p>
<p>According to rumors, it seems the legal situation of the movie was not researched thoroughly before going into post production.</p>
<p>It is a pity, because we were at a stage, where all the pipelines were set up and we just started our first two full CG shots. We were actually starting to have some good old VFX fun. But not anymore. Now we have 20 people hunting for jobs again.</p>
<p>It really makes me sad to give up a great little company. We had a killer team. Thanks to all of you for being so great.</p>
<p>P.S.: If anyone has an open position for a compositor or VFX producer let me know.</p>
