		<p>I have been hired at [Pixomondo Images] <a href="http://www.pixomondo.com/">1</a> in Ludwigsburg to work as VFX Coordinator for some of their recent projects. This is an exciting opportunity.  The company size is considerably bigger then most companies I have worked so far and I have to handle several smaller projects instead of one or two big projects. That is a new challenge and I am looking forward to master it in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Being a part of Pixomondo makes me proud, as this is a very professional, yet cool company to work for. I have a chance to stay with them for a longer time if I am not messing up the first 1,5 test months. Wish me luck.</p>
